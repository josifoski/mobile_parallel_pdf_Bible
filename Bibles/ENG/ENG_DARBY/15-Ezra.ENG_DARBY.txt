{1:1} And in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, and he made a proclamation throughout his kingdom, and also in writing, saying,
{1:2} Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: All the kingdoms of the earth has Jehovah the God of the heavens given to me, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
{1:3} Whosoever there is among you of all his people, his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of Jehovah the God of Israel -- he is God -- which is at Jerusalem.
{1:4} And whosoever remains in any place where he sojourns, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, besides the voluntary offering for the house of God which is at Jerusalem.
{1:5} And the chief fathers of Judah and Benjamin rose up, and the priests, and the Levites, even all those whose spirit God had stirred, to go up to build the house of Jehovah which is at Jerusalem.
{1:6} And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with articles of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered.
{1:7} And king Cyrus brought forth the vessels of the house of Jehovah, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem and had put in the house of his god.
{1:8} And Cyrus king of Persia brought them forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.
{1:9} And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine-and-twenty knives,
{1:10} thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand.
{1:11} All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand four hundred. The whole did Sheshbazzar bring up, when they of the captivity were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem.
{2:1} And these are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away to Babylon, and who came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one to his city,

{2:58} All the Nethinim and the children of Solomon's servants, three hundred and ninety-two.
{2:59} And these are they that went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub-Addan, Immer; but they could not shew their fathers' house, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel.
{2:60} The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobijah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred and fifty-two.
{2:61} And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai; who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name.
{2:62} These sought their genealogical register, but they were not found; therefore were they, as polluted, removed from the priesthood.
{2:63} And the Tirshatha said to them that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim.
{2:64} The whole congregation together was forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty,
{2:65} besides their servants and their maids, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven; and they had two hundred singing men and singing women.
{2:66} Their horses were seven hundred and thirty-six; their mules two hundred and forty-five;
{2:67} their camels four hundred and thirty-five; the asses six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
{2:68} And some of the chief fathers, when they came to the house of Jehovah which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to set it up in its place.
{2:69} They gave after their ability to the treasure of the work sixty-one thousand darics of gold, and five thousand pounds of silver, and one hundred priests' coats.
{2:70} And the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the doorkeepers, and the Nethinim dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
{3:1} And when the seventh month came, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered together as one man to Jerusalem.
{3:2} Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer up burnt-offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God
{3:3} And they set the altar on its base; for fear was upon them because of the people of the countries; and they offered up burnt-offerings on it to Jehovah, the morning and evening burnt-offerings.
{3:4} And they held the feast of tabernacles as it is written, and offered daily burnt-offerings by number, according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day required;
{3:5} and afterwards the continual burnt-offering, and those of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of Jehovah that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a voluntary offering to Jehovah.
{3:6} From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer up burnt-offerings to Jehovah. But the foundation of the temple of Jehovah was not yet laid.
{3:7} And they gave money to the masons and to the carpenters; and meat and drink and oil to the Zidonians and to the Tyrians, to bring cedar-trees from Lebanon to the sea at Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.
{3:8} And in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem; and they appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to superintend the work of the house of Jehovah.
{3:9} And Jeshua stood up, his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, as one man, to superintend the workmen in the house of God also the sons of Henadad, their sons and their brethren, the Levites.
{3:10} And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah, they set the priests in their apparel, with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise Jehovah according to the directions of David king of Israel.
{3:11} And they sang alternately together in praising and giving thanks to Jehovah: For he is good, for his loving-kindness endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout to the praise of Jehovah, because the foundation of the house of Jehovah was laid.
{3:12} But many of the priests and Levites and chief fathers, the ancient men that had seen the first house, wept with a loud voice, when the foundation of this house was laid in their sight; and many shouted aloud for joy.
{3:13} And the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a great shout, and the noise was heard afar off.
{4:1} And the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building the temple to Jehovah the God of Israel;
{4:2} and they came to Zerubbabel and to the chief fathers, and said to them, We would build with you; for we seek your God as ye; and we have sacrificed to him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assyria, who brought us up hither.
{4:3} But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the chief fathers of Israel said to them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build a house to our God but we alone will build to Jehovah the God of Israel, as king Cyrus, the king of Persia, has commanded us.
{4:4} And the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building;
{4:5} and they hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
{4:6} And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
{4:7} And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions, wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in Aramaic, and interpreted in Aramaic.
{4:8} Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king after this sort:
{4:9} Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions, the Dinaites, and the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehaites, the Elamites,
{4:10} and the rest of the peoples whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over and settled in the cities of Samaria, and the rest of the country on this side the river, and so forth.
{4:11} This is the copy of the letter that they sent to him: To Artaxerxes the king: Thy servants the men on this side the river, and so forth.
{4:12} Be it known to the king that the Jews who came up from thee unto us have come to Jerusalem; they are building the rebellious and the bad city, and they complete the walls and join up the foundations.
{4:13} Be it known therefore unto the king, that, if this city be built and the walls be completed, they will not pay tribute, tax, and toll, and in the end it will bring damage to the kings.
{4:14} Now, since we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not right for us to see the king's injury, therefore have we sent and informed the king;
{4:15} that search may be made in the book of the annals of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the annals and know that this city is a rebellious city, which has done damage to kings and provinces, and that they have raised sedition within the same of old time, for which cause this city was destroyed.
{4:16} We inform the king that if this city be built and its walls be completed, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river.
{4:17} The king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and the other places beyond the river: Peace, and so forth.
{4:18} The letter that ye sent to us has been read before me distinctly.
{4:19} And I gave orders, and search has been made, and it has been found that this city of old time has made insurrection against the kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been raised therein.
{4:20} And there have been mighty kings over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all beyond the river; and tribute, tax, and toll were paid to them.
{4:21} Now give order to make these men to cease, and that this city be not built, until the order shall be given from me;
{4:22} and take heed that ye fail not to do this: why should harm grow to the damage of the kings?
{4:23} As soon as the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them cease by force and power.
{4:24} Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
{5:1} Now the prophets, Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem; in the name of the God of Israel did they prophesy to them.
{5:2} Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God who helped them.
{5:3} At that time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shethar-boznai, and their companions, and said thus to them: Who gave you orders to build this house and to complete this wall?
{5:4} And they said to them after this manner: What are the names of the men that build this building?
{5:5} But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not make them cease till the matter came to Darius; and then they returned answer by letter concerning it.
{5:6} The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shethar-boznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, who were on this side the river, sent to Darius the king.
{5:7} They sent a report to him in which was written thus: To Darius the king, all peace!
{5:8} Be it known to the king that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God which is being built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work is being carried on with diligence, and prospers in their hand.
{5:9} Then asked we those elders: thus we said to them, Who gave you orders to build this house and to complete this wall?
{5:10} We asked their names also, to inform thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them.
{5:11} And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of the heavens and the earth, and build the house that was built these many years ago; and a great king of Israel built and completed it.
{5:12} But after that our fathers had provoked the God of the heavens to wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, and he destroyed this house, and carried the people away unto Babylon.
{5:13} But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, king Cyrus gave orders to build this house of God
{5:14} And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was at Jerusalem and brought into the temple of Babylon, those did king Cyrus take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one Sheshbazzar by name, whom he had appointed governor.
{5:15} And he said to him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is at Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built in its place.
{5:16} Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and since that time even until now has it been in building, and it is not completed.
{5:17} And now, if it seem good to the king, let search be made in the king's treasure-house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that orders were given by king Cyrus to build this house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.
{6:1} Then king Darius gave orders, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.
{6:2} And there was found at Achmetha in the fortress that is in the province of Media a roll, and therein was a record thus written:
{6:3} In the first year of king Cyrus, king Cyrus made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem: Let the house be built for a place where they offer sacrifices, and let its foundations be solidly laid; its height sixty cubits, its breadth sixty cubits,
{6:4} with three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber; and let the expenses be given out of the king's house:
{6:5} and also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that is at Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be restored and brought again to the temple that is at Jerusalem, in their place; and thou shalt put them in the house of God
{6:6} Therefore Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shethar-boznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, who are beyond the river, be ye far from thence:
{6:7} let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place.
{6:8} Moreover, I give orders what ye shall do to these elders of the Jews, for the building of this house of God that of the king's goods, of the tribute beyond the river, expenses be diligently given to these men, that they be not hindered.
{6:9} And that which they have need of, both young bullocks and rams and lambs, for the burnt-offerings to the God of the heavens, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests that are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail;
{6:10} that they may present sweet odours to the God of the heavens, and pray for the life of the king and of his sons.
{6:11} Also I have given order that whosoever shall alter this rescript, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon, and let his house be made a dunghill for this.
{6:12} And the God that has caused his name to dwell there overthrow every king and people that shall put forth their hand to alter or to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have given this order; let it be done diligently.
{6:13} Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shethar-boznai, and their companions, because of that which king Darius had sent, did so diligently.
{6:14} And the elders of the Jews built; and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they built and completed it according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.
{6:15} And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of king Darius.
{6:16} And the children of Israel, the priests and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy;
{6:17} and they presented at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and for a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
{6:18} And they set the priests in their classes, and the Levites in their divisions, for the service of God which is at Jerusalem: as it is written in the book of Moses.
{6:19} And the children of the captivity held the passover upon the fourteenth of the first month.
{6:20} For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves as one man: they were all pure; and they killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.
{6:21} And the children of Israel that were come back out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the nations of the land, to seek Jehovah the God of Israel, did eat;
{6:22} and they kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy; for Jehovah had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God the God of Israel.
{7:1} And after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes, king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkijah,
{7:2} the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,
{7:3} the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,
{7:4} the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,
{7:5} the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest,
{7:6} --this Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which Jehovah the God of Israel had given. And the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of Jehovah his God upon him.
{7:7} (And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the doorkeepers, and the Nethinim, to Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.)
{7:8} And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.
{7:9} For upon the first of the first month the project of going up from Babylon was determined on, and on the first of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.
{7:10} For Ezra had directed his heart to seek the law of Jehovah and to do it, and to teach in Israel the statutes and the ordinances.
{7:11} And this is the copy of the letter that king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, a scribe of the words of the commandments of Jehovah, and of his statutes to Israel:
{7:12} Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, an accomplished scribe of the law of the God of the heavens, and so forth.
{7:13} I have given orders that all they of the people of Israel, and of their priests and the Levites, in my realm, who are disposed to go to Jerusalem, go with thee.
{7:14} Because thou art sent by the king, and by his seven counsellors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thy hand;
{7:15} and to carry the silver and gold which the king and his counsellors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose habitation is at Jerusalem,
{7:16} and all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, besides the voluntary offering of the people, and of the priests, who offer willingly for the house of their God which is at Jerusalem.
{7:17} Therefore thou shalt buy diligently with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their oblations and their drink-offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is at Jerusalem.
{7:18} And whatever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do according to the will of your God
{7:19} And the vessels that have been given thee for the service of the house of thy God deliver before the God of Jerusalem.
{7:20} And whatever more shall be needful for the house of thy God which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure house.
{7:21} And I, I Artaxerxes the king, do give orders to all the treasurers that are beyond the river, that whatever Ezra the priest and scribe of the law of the God of the heavens shall require of you, it be done diligently,
{7:22} unto a hundred talents of silver, and to a hundred measures of wheat, and to a hundred baths of wine, and to a hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.
{7:23} Whatever is commanded by the God of the heavens, let it be carefully done for the house of the God of the heavens; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?
{7:24} Also we inform you, as regards all the priests and Levites, singers, doorkeepers, Nethinim, and ministers of this house of God it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, tax, and toll upon them.
{7:25} And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God which is in thy hand, set magistrates and judges who may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God and teach ye him that knows them not.
{7:26} And whosoever will not do the law of thy God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed diligently upon him, whether unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.
{7:27} Blessed be Jehovah the God of our fathers, who has put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of Jehovah which is at Jerusalem;
{7:28} and has extended mercy to me before the king and his counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened, as the hand of Jehovah my God was upon me; and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.
{8:1} And these are the chief fathers, and their genealogy, who went up with me from Babylon in the reign of Artaxerxes the king.
{8:2} Of the children of Phinehas, Gershom; of the children of Ithamar, Daniel; of the children of David, Hattush;
{8:3} of the children of Shecaniah, of the children of Parosh, Zechariah, and with him were registered by genealogy of the males a hundred and fifty.
{8:4} Of the children of Pahath-Moab, Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males.
{8:5} Of the children of Shechaniah, the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males.
{8:6} And of the children of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males.
{8:7} And of the children of Elam, Isaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males.
{8:8} And of the children of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him eighty males.
{8:9} Of the children of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males.
{8:10} And of the children of Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah, and with him a hundred and sixty males.
{8:11} And of the children of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty-eight males.
{8:12} And of the children of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him a hundred and ten males.
{8:13} And of the children of Adonikam, the last ones, whose names are these: Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them sixty males.
{8:14} And of the children of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud, and with them seventy males.
{8:15} And I gathered them together at the river that runs to Ahava; and there we encamped three days; and I surveyed the people and the priests, and found none of the sons of Levi there.
{8:16} And I sent for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men, and for Joiarib and for Elnathan, men of understanding.
{8:17} And I gave them a commission to Iddo the chief, at the place Casiphia, and I put words in their mouths to say to Iddo and his brethren the Nethinim, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God
{8:18} And by the good hand of our God upon us, they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel, namely, Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;
{8:19} and Hashabiah, and with him Isaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;
{8:20} and of the Nethinim, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim: all of them were expressed by name.
{8:21} And I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.
{8:22} For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way; for we had spoken to the king saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his anger is against all them that forsake him.
{8:23} And we fasted, and besought our God for this; and he was entreated of us.
{8:24} And I separated twelve of the chiefs of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,
{8:25} and I weighed to them the silver and the gold and the vessels, the heave-offering for the house of our God which the king and his counsellors and his princes, and all Israel present, had offered.
{8:26} And I weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver; and silver vessels a hundred talents, and of gold a hundred talents;
{8:27} and twenty basons of gold, of a thousand darics; and two vessels of shining copper, precious as gold.
{8:28} And I said to them, Ye are holy unto Jehovah; the vessels also are holy; and the silver and the gold is a voluntary offering to Jehovah the God of your fathers.
{8:29} Watch and keep them until ye weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the chiefs of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of Jehovah.
{8:30} And the priests and the Levites received by weight the silver and the gold and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God
{8:31} And we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth of the first month, to go to Jerusalem; and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.
{8:32} And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.
{8:33} And on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Urijah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them were Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites:
{8:34} the whole by number and by weight; and all the weight was written down at that time.
{8:35} The children of those that had been carried away, who had come out of the captivity, presented burnt-offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin-offering: all for a burnt-offering to Jehovah.
{8:36} And they delivered the king's edicts to the king's satraps, and to the governors on this side the river. And they furthered the people and the house of God.
{9:1} Now when these things were completed, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites;
{9:2} for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, and have mingled the holy seed with the peoples of the lands; and the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this unfaithfulness.
{9:3} And when I heard this thing, I rent my mantle and my garment, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down overwhelmed.
{9:4} Then were assembled to me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the unfaithfulness of those that had been carried away; and I sat overwhelmed until the evening oblation.
{9:5} And at the evening oblation I arose up from my humiliation; and with my mantle and my garment rent, I fell on my knees, and spread out my hands to Jehovah my God
{9:6} and said: O my God I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up to the heavens.
{9:7} Since the days of our fathers, we have been in great trespass to this day; and for our iniquities we, our kings, our priests, have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, and to captivity, and to spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.
{9:8} And now for a little space there hath been favour from Jehovah our God to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
{9:9} For we are bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us before the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God and to repair the ruins thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.
{9:10} And now, what shall we say, our God after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,
{9:11} which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land through the filthiness of the peoples of the lands, through their abominations with which they have filled it from one end to another through their uncleanness.
{9:12} Now therefore give not your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters to your sons, nor seek their peace or their prosperity for ever; that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.
{9:13} And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this,
{9:14} should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the peoples of these abominations? wouldest thou not be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor any to escape?
{9:15} Jehovah, God of Israel, thou art righteous; for we are a remnant that is escaped, as it is this day. Behold, we are before thee in our trespasses; for there is no standing before thee because of this.
{10:1} And while Ezra prayed, and made confession, weeping and falling down before the house of God there were gathered to him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children; for the people wept very much.
{10:2} And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, We have acted unfaithfully toward our God and have taken foreign wives of the peoples of the land; yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing.
{10:3} And now let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandments of our God and let it be done according to the law.
{10:4} Arise, for this matter is incumbent on thee, and we will be with thee: be of good courage, and do it.
{10:5} Then Ezra arose, and made the chiefs of the priests, of the Levites, and of all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. And they swore.
{10:6} And Ezra arose from before the house of God and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib; and when he came thither, he ate no bread and drank no water; for he mourned because of the unfaithfulness of them that had been carried away.
{10:7} And they made proclamation in Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;
{10:8} and that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be confiscated, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.
{10:9} Then were all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered together at Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth of the month; and all the people sat in the open space of the house of God trembling because of the matter, and because of the pouring rain.
{10:10} And Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, Ye have acted unfaithfully, and have taken foreign wives, to increase the trespass of Israel.
{10:11} And now make confession to Jehovah the God of your fathers, and do his pleasure, and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign wives.
{10:12} And the whole congregation answered and said with a loud voice, Yes, it is for us to do according to thy words.
{10:13} But the people are many, and it is a time of pouring rain, and it is not possible to stand without: neither is this a work for one day or two; for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.
{10:14} Let now our princes, while this matter is going on, stand for all the congregation, and let all those that have taken foreign wives in our cities come at the appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce anger of our God be turned from us.
{10:15} Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this; and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
{10:16} And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest and certain of the chief fathers were separated according to their fathers' houses, and all of them expressed by name; and they sat down on the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
{10:17} And they ended with all the men that had taken foreign wives by the first day of the first month.
{10:18} And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken foreign wives, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren: Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.
{10:19} And they gave their hand to send away their wives; and they offered a ram of the flock, as trespass-offering for their guilt.
{10:20} And of the children of Immer: Hanani, and Zebadiah.
{10:21} And of the children of Harim: Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah.
{10:22} And of the children of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah.
{10:23} And of the Levites: Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah (that is, Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.
{10:24} And of the singers: Eliashib. And of the doorkeepers: Shallum, and Telem, and Uri.
{10:25} And of Israel; of the children of Parosh: Ramiah, and Jizzijah, and Malchijah, and Mijamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah.
{10:26} And of the children of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Elijah.
{10:27} And of the children of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza.
{10:28} And of the children of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, Athlai.
{10:29} And of the children of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and Sheal, and Ramoth.
{10:30} And of the children of Pahath-Moab: Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezaleel, and Binnui, and Manasseh.
{10:31} And the children of Harim: Eliezer, Jishijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Simeon,
{10:32} Benjamin, Malluch, Shemariah.
{10:33} Of the children of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, Shimei.
{10:34} Of the sons of Bani: Maadai, Amram, and Uel,
{10:35} Benaiah, Bediah, Cheluhu,
{10:36} Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,
{10:37} Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasai,
{10:38} and Bani, and Binnui, Shimei,
{10:39} and Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah,
{10:40} Machnadbai, Shashai, Sharai,
{10:41} Azareel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah,
{10:42} Shallum, Amariah, Joseph.
{10:43} Of the children of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, and Joel, Benaiah.
{10:44} All these had taken foreign wives; and there were among them wives who had had children.

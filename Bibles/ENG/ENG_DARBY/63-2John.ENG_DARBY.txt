{1:1} The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not I only but also all who have known the truth,
{1:2} for the truth's sake which abides in us and shall be with us to eternity.
{1:3} Grace shall be with you, mercy, peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
{1:4} I rejoiced greatly that I have found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received commandment from the Father.
{1:5} And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing to thee a new commandment, but that which we have had from the beginning, that we should love one another.
{1:6} And this is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, according as ye have heard from the beginning, that ye might walk in it.
{1:7} For many deceivers have gone out into the world, they who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in flesh--this is the deceiver and the antichrist.
{1:8} See to yourselves, that we may not lose what we have wrought, but may receive full wages.
{1:9} Whosoever goes forward and abides not in the doctrine of the Christ has not God. He that abides in the doctrine, he has both the Father and the Son.
{1:10} If any one come to you and bring not this doctrine, do not receive him into the house, and greet him not;
{1:11} for he who greets him partakes in his wicked works.
{1:12} Having many things to write to you, I would not with paper and ink; but hope to come to you, and to speak mouth to mouth, that our joy may be full.
{1:13} The children of thine elect sister greet thee.

{1:1} Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will, according to promise of life, the life which is in Christ Jesus,
{1:2} to Timotheus, my beloved child: grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord.
{1:3} I am thankful to God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, how unceasingly I have the remembrance of thee in my supplications night and day,
{1:4} earnestly desiring to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;
{1:5} calling to mind the unfeigned faith which has been in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and in thy mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that in thee also.
{1:6} For which cause I put thee in mind to rekindle the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.
{1:7} For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power, and of love, and of wise discretion.
{1:8} Be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but suffer evil along with the glad tidings, according to the power of God;
{1:9} who has saved us, and has called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the ages of time,
{1:10} but has been made manifest now by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who has annulled death, and brought to light life and incorruptibility by the glad tidings;
{1:11} to which I have been appointed a herald and apostle and teacher of the nations.
{1:12} For which cause also I suffer these things; but I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep for that day the deposit I have entrusted to him.
{1:13} Have an outline of sound words, which words thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.
{1:14} Keep, by the Holy Spirit which dwells in us, the good deposit entrusted.
{1:15} Thou knowest this, that all who are in Asia, of whom is Phygellus and Hermogenes, have turned away from me.
{1:16} The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he has often refreshed me, and has not been ashamed of my chain;
{1:17} but being in Rome sought me out very diligently, and found me --
{1:18} the Lord grant to him to find mercy from the Lord in that day--and how much service he rendered in Ephesus thou knowest best.
{2:1} Thou therefore, my child, be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.
{2:2} And the things thou hast heard of me in the presence of many witnesses, these entrust to faithful men, such as shall be competent to instruct others also.
{2:3} Take thy share in suffering as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
{2:4} No one going as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of life, that he may please him who has enlisted him as a soldier.
{2:5} And if also any one contend in the games, he is not crowned unless he contend lawfully.
{2:6} The husbandman must labour before partaking of the fruits.
{2:7} Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things.
{2:8} Remember Jesus Christ raised from among the dead, of the seed of David, according to my glad tidings,
{2:9} in which I suffer even unto bonds as an evil-doer: but the word of God is not bound.
{2:10} For this cause I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
{2:11} The word is faithful; for if we have died together with him, we shall also live together;
{2:12} if we endure, we shall also reign together; if we deny, he also will deny us;
{2:13} if we are unfaithful, he abides faithful, for he cannot deny himself.
{2:14} Of these things put in remembrance, testifying earnestly before the Lord not to have disputes of words, profitable for nothing, to the subversion of the hearers.
{2:15} Strive diligently to present thyself approved to God, a workman that has not to be ashamed, cutting in a straight line the word of truth.
{2:16} But profane, vain babblings shun, for they will advance to greater impiety,
{2:17} and their word will spread as a gangrene; of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;
{2:18} men who as to the truth have gone astray, saying that the resurrection has taken place already; and overthrow the faith of some.
{2:19} Yet the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, The Lord knows those that are his; and, Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity.
{2:20} But in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also wooden and earthen; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.
{2:21} If therefore one shall have purified himself from these, in separating himself from them, he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified, serviceable to the Master, prepared for every good work.
{2:22} But youthful lusts flee, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart.
{2:23} But foolish and senseless questionings avoid, knowing that they beget contentions.
{2:24} And a bondman of the Lord ought not to contend, but be gentle towards all; apt to teach; forbearing;
{2:25} in meekness setting right those who oppose, if God perhaps may sometime give them repentance to acknowledgment of the truth,
{2:26} and that they may awake up out of the snare of the devil, who are taken by him, for his will.
{3:1} But this know, that in the last days difficult times shall be there;
{3:2} for men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, evil speakers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, profane,
{3:3} without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, of unsubdued passions, savage, having no love for what is good,
{3:4} traitors, headlong, of vain pretensions, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;
{3:5} having a form of piety but denying the power of it: and from these turn away.
{3:6} For of these are they who are getting into houses, and leading captive silly women, laden with sins, led by various lusts,
{3:7} always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
{3:8} Now in the same manner in which Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, thus these also withstand the truth; men corrupted in mind, found worthless as regards the faith.
{3:9} But they shall not advance farther; for their folly shall be completely manifest to all, as that of those also became.
{3:10} But thou hast been thoroughly acquainted with my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, endurance,
{3:11} persecutions, sufferings: what sufferings happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured; and the Lord delivered me out of all.
{3:12} And all indeed who desire to live piously in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
{3:13} But wicked men and juggling impostors shall advance in evil, leading and being led astray.
{3:14} But thou, abide in those things which thou hast learned, and of which thou hast been fully persuaded, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;
{3:15} and that from a child thou hast known the sacred letters, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation, through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
{3:16} Every scripture is divinely inspired, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness;
{3:17} that the man of God may be complete, fully fitted to every good work.
{4:1} I testify before God and Christ Jesus, who is about to judge living and dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom,
{4:2} proclaim the word; be urgent in season and out of season, convict, rebuke, encourage, with all longsuffering and doctrine.
{4:3} For the time shall be when they will not bear sound teaching; but according to their own lusts will heap up to themselves teachers, having an itching ear;
{4:4} and they will turn away their ear from the truth, and will have turned aside to fables.
{4:5} But thou, be sober in all things, bear evils, do the work of an evangelist, fill up the full measure of thy ministry.
{4:6} For I am already being poured out, and the time of my release is come.
{4:7} I have combated the good combat, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.
{4:8} Henceforth the crown of righteousness is laid up for me, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will render to me in that day; but not only to me, but also to all who love his appearing.
{4:9} Use diligence to come to me quickly;
{4:10} for Demas has forsaken me, having loved the present age, and is gone to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
{4:11} Luke alone is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thyself, for he is serviceable to me for ministry.
{4:12} But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.
{4:13} The cloak which I left behind me in Troas at Carpus's, bring when thou comest, and the books, especially the parchments.
{4:14} Alexander the smith did many evil things against me. The Lord will render to him according to his works.
{4:15} Against whom be thou also on thy guard, for he has greatly withstood our words.
{4:16} At my first defence no man stood with me, but all deserted me. May it not be imputed to them.
{4:17} But the Lord stood with me, and gave me power, that through me the proclamation might be fully made, and all those of the nations should hear; and I was delivered out of the lion's mouth.
{4:18} The Lord shall deliver me from every wicked work, and shall preserve me for his heavenly kingdom; to whom be glory for the ages of ages. Amen.
{4:19} Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.
{4:20} Erastus remained in Corinth, but Trophimus I left behind in Miletus sick.
{4:21} Use diligence to come before winter. Eubulus salutes thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and the brethren all.
{4:22} The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you.

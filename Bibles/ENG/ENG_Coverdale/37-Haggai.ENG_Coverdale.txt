{1:1} In the seconde yeare of kynge Darius, in the vj. moneth the first daye of the moneth, came the worde of the LORDE (by the prophet Aggeus) vnto Zorobabel the sonne of Salathiel ye prynce of Iuda, and to Iesua the sonne of Iosedec the hye prest, sayenge:
{1:2} Thus speaketh the LORDE of hoostes, and saieth: This people doth saye: The tyme is not yet come to buylde vp the LORDES house.
{1:3} Then spake the LORDE by the prophet Aggeus & sayed:
{1:4} Ye yor selues can fynde tyme to dwell in syled houses, and shal this house lye waist?
{1:5} Considre now youre owne wayes in youre hertes (saieth ye LORDE of hoostes)
{1:6} ye sowe moch, but ye bringe litle in: Ye eate, but ye haue not ynough: ye drinke, but ye are not fylled: ye decke youre selues, but ye are not warme: & he yt earneth eny wage, putteth it in a broken purse.
{1:7} Thus saieth the LORDE of hoostes: Cosidre youre owne wayes in youre hertes,
{1:8} get you vp to the mountayne, fetch wod, & buylde vp the house: that it maye be acceptable vnto me, and that I maye shewe myne honoure, saieth the LORDE.
{1:9} Ye loked for moch, and lo it is come to litle: & though ye brynge it home, yet do I blowe it awaye. And why so, saieth the LORDE of hoostes? Eue because that my house lyeth so waist, and ye renne euery man vnto his owne house.
{1:10} Wherfore the heauen is forbydde to geue you eny dew, and the earth is forbydden to geue you encrease.
{1:11} I haue called for a drouth, both vpo the londe & vpon the mountaynes, vpon corne, vpon wyne & vpon oyle, vpon euery thinge that the grounde bryngeth forth, vpon men and vpon catell, yee and vpon all handy laboure.
{1:12} Now when Zorobabel the sonne of Salathiel, & Iesua the sonne of Iosedec the hye prest with the remnaunt of the people, herde the voyce of the LORDE their God, & the wordes of the prophet Aggeus (like as the LORDE their God had sent him) the people dyd feare the LORDE.
{1:13} Then Aggeus the LORDES angel sayed in the LORDES message vnto the people: I am wt you, saieth the LORDE.
{1:14} So the LORDE waked vp the sprete of Zorobabel the prynce of Iuda, and the sprete of Iesua the sonne of Iosedec the hye prest, and the sprete of the remnaunt of all the people: yt they came & laboured, in the house of the LORDE of hoostes their God.
{1:15} Vpon the xxiiij. daye of the sixte moneth, in the secode yeare of kinge Darius,
{2:1} The xxi. daye of the seuenth moneth, came the worde of the LORDE by the prophet Aggeus, sayenge:
{2:2} speake to Zorobabel the sonne of Salathiel prynce of Iuda, and to Iesua the sonne of Iosedec the hye prest, and to the residue of ye people, & saye:
{2:3} Who is left amoge you, that sawe this house in hir first beuty? But what thinke ye now by it? Is it not in youre eyes, eue as though it were nothinge?
{2:4} Neuerthelesse be of good chere, o Zorobabel (saieth the LORDE) be of good conforte, o Iesua thou sonne of Iosedec, hye prest: take good hartes vnto you also, all ye people of the londe, saieth the LORDE of hoostes,
{2:5} and do acordinge to the worde (for I am with you, saieth the LORDE of hoostes) like as I agreed with you, when ye came out of the londe of Egypte: & my sprete shalbe amonge you, feare ye not.
{2:6} For thus saieth the LORDE of hoostes: Yet once more will I shake heaue and earth, the see and the drye lode:
{2:7} Yee I will moue all Heithen, & the comforte of all Heithen shall come, & so wil I fyll this house with honoure, saieth the LORDE of hoostes.
{2:8} The syluer is myne, & the golde is myne, saieth the LORDE of hoostes.
{2:9} Thus ye glory of the last house shalbe greater the the first, saieth the LORDE of hoostes: & in this place wil I geue peace, saieth the LORDE of hoostes.
{2:10} The xxiiij. daye of the ix moneth in the seconde yeare of kinge Darius, came the worde of the LORDE vnto the prophet Aggeus sayenge:
{2:11} Thus saieth ye LORDE God of hoostes: Axe the prestes concernynge the lawe, & saye:
{2:12} Yf one beare holy flesh in his cote lappe, & with his lappe do touch the bred, potage, wyne, oyle or eny other meate: shall he be holy also? The prestes answered, & saide: No.
{2:13} Then sayde Aggeus: Now yf one beynge defyled with a deed carcase, touch eny of the se: shall it also be vnclene?
{2:14} The prestes gaue answere & sayed: yee, it shall be vnclene. The Aggeus answered, and sayde: Euen so is this people & this nacion before me, saieth ye LORDE: and so are all the workes of their hodes, yee and all that they offre, is vnclene.
{2:15} And now (I praye you) cosidre from this daye forth, and how it hath gone with you afore: or euer there was layed one stone vpo another in the temple of the LORDE:
{2:16} that when ye came to a corne heape of xx. busshels, there were scarce ten: and that when ye came to the wyne presse for to poure out L. pottes of wyne, there were scarce xx.
{2:17} For I smote you with heate, blastinge & hale stones in all the labours of youre hondes: yet was there none of you, that wolde turne vnto me, saieth the LORDE.
{2:18} Considre then from this daye forth and afore, namely, from the xxiiij. daye of the ix. moneth, vnto the daye that the foundacion of the LORDES temple was layed: Marck it well,
{2:19} Is not the sede yet in the barne? haue not the vynes, the fygetrees, the pomgranates and olyue trees bene yet vnfrutefull? but fro this daye forth, I shal make them to prospere.
{2:20} Morouer the xxiiij. daye of the moneth came the worde of the LORDE vnto Aggeus agayne, sayenge:
{2:21} Speake to Zorobabel the prynce of Iuda, and saye: I will shake both heauen and earth,
{2:22} and ouerthrowe the seate of the kingdomes, yee & destroye the mightie kingdome of the Heithe. I wil ouerthrowe the charettes, and those that syt vpon them, so that both horse and man shal fall downe, euery man thorow his neghbours swerde.
{2:23} And as for the, o Zorobabel (saieth the LORDE of hoostes) thou sonne of Salathiel, my seruaunt: I wil take the (saieth the LORDE) at the same tyme, and make the as a seale: for I haue chosen the, saieth the LORDE of hoostes.

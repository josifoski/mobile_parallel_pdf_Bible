{1:1} In the eight moneth of the secode yeare of kinge Darius, came the worde of the LORDE vnto Zachary the sonne of Barachias, the sonne of Addo, the prophet, sayenge:
{1:2} The LORDE hath bene sore displeased at youre forefathers.
{1:3} And saye thou vnto them: thus saieth the LORDE of hoostes. Turne you vnto me (saieth the LORDE of hoostes) and I wil turne me vnto you, saieth the LORDE of hoostes.
{1:4} Be not ye like youre forefathers, vnto whom the prophetes cried a fore tyme, sayege: Thus saieth the LORDE God of hoostes: Turne you from youre euell wayes, & from youre wicked ymaginacions. But they wolde not heare, ner regarde me, saieth the LORDE.
{1:5} What is now become of youre forefathers and the prophetes? are they yet still alyue?
{1:6} But dyd not my wordes & statutes (which I comaunded by my seruauntes ye prophetes) touch yor forefathers? Vpo this, they gaue answere & sayde: like as ye LORDE of hoostes deuysed to do vnto vs, acordinge to or owne wayes & ymaginacions, euen so hath he dealte with vs.
{1:7} Vpon the xxiiij. daye of the xj. moneth (which is the moneth Sebat) in the seconde yeare of Darius, came the worde of the LORDE vnto Zachary the sonne of Barachias, the sonne of Addo the prophete, sayenge:
{1:8} I sawe by night, and lo, there sat one vpon a reade horse, and stode still amonge the Myrte trees, that were beneth vpon the grounde: and behynde him were there reade, spreckled and whyte horses.
{1:9} Then sayde I: O my LORDE, what are these? And the angel that talked with me, sayed vnto me: I will shewe the what these be.
{1:10} And the man that stode amoge the Myrte trees, answered & sayde: These are they, whom the LORDE hath sent to go thorow the worlde.
{1:11} And they answered the angel of the LORDE, that stode amonge the Myrte trees, and sayde: We haue gone thorow the worlde: and beholde, all the worlde dwell at ease, and are carelesse.
{1:12} Then the LORDES angel gaue answere and sayde: O LORDE of hoostes, how longe wilt thou be vnmercifull to Ierusale and to the cities of Iuda, with whom thou hast bene displeased now these lxx. yeares?
{1:13} So the LORDE gaue a louynge and a confortable answere, vnto the angel that talked with me.
{1:14} And the angel that commoned with me, sayde vnto me: Crie thou, and speake, thus saieth the LORDE of hoostes: I am exceadynge gelous ouer Ierusalem and Sion,
{1:15} and sore displeased at the carelesse Heithen: for where as I was but a litle angrie, they dyd their best that I might destroye them
{1:16} Therfore thus saieth the LORDE: I wil turne me agayne in mercy towarde Ierusalem, so that my house shalbe buylded in it, saieth the LORDE of hoostes: yee and the plommet shal be layed abrode in Ierusalem, saieth the LORDE of hoostes.
{1:17} Crie also, and speake: thus saieth the LORDE of hoostes: My cities shall be in good prosperite agayne, the LORDE shall yet conforte Sion, and chose Ierusalem.
{1:18} Then lift I vp myne eyes and sawe, and beholde, foure hornes.
{1:19} And I sayde vnto the angel, that talked with me: what be these? he answered me: These are ye hornes, which haue scatred Iuda, Israel and Ierusalem abrode.
{1:20} And ye LORDE shewed me iiij. carpenters.
{1:21} Then sayde I: what wil these do? He answered, & sayde: Those are the hornes, which haue so strowed Iuda abrode, that no man durst lift vp his heade: But these are come to fraye them awaye, and to cast out ye hornes of the Gentiles, which lift vp their horne ouer the londe of Iuda, to scatre it abrode.
{2:1} I lift vp myne eyes agayne, & loked: and beholde, a man with a measure lyne in his honde.
{2:2} Then saide I: whether goest thou? And he sayde vnto me: To measure Ierusalem, that I maye se how longe and how brode it is.
{2:3} And beholde, the angel that talked wt me, wente his waye forth. Then wete there out another angel to mete him,
{2:4} & sayde vnto him: Runne, speake to this yonge man, & saye: Ierusalem shal be inhabited without eny wal, for ye very multitude of people & catell, yt shal be therin.
{2:5} Yee I myself (saieth the LORDE) wil be vnto her a wall of fyre rounde aboute, & wilbe honoured in her.
{2:6} O get you forth, O fle from the londe of ye north (saieth the LORDE) ye, whom I haue scatred in to the foure wyndes vnder heaue, saieth the LORDE.
{2:7} Saue thy self, o Sion: thou that dwellest with ye doughter of Babilon,
{2:8} for thus saieth the LORDE of hoostes: With a glorious power hath he sent me out to the Heithe, which spoyled you: for who so toucheth you, shal touche the aple of his owne eye.
{2:9} Beholde, I will lift vp myne honde ouer them: so that they shal be spoyled of those, which afore serued them: & ye shal knowe, that the LORDE of hoostes hath sent me.
{2:10} Be glad, & reioyce, o doughter of Sion: for lo, I am come to dwell in the myddest of the, saieth the LORDE.
{2:11} At the same tyme there shal many Heithen cleue to the LORDE, & shal be my people. Thus wil I dwel in the myddest of the, & thou shalt knowe, that the LORDE of hoostes hath sent me vnto the.
{2:12} The LORDE shall haue Iuda in possession for his parte in the holy grounde, & shal chose Ierusalem yet agayne.
{2:13} Let all flesh be still before the LORDE, for he is rysen out of his holy place.
{3:1} And he shewed me Iesua ye hye prest, stondinge before the angel of the LORDE, and Satan stode at his right honde to resiste him.
{3:2} And the LORDE sayde vnto Satan: The LORDE reproue the (thou Satan) yee the LORDE that hath chosen Ierusalem, reproue the. Is not this a brande take out of the fyre?
{3:3} Now Iesua was clothed in vnclene rayment, and stode before the angel:
{3:4} which answered & sayde vnto those, yt stode before him: take awaye ye foule clothes from him. And vnto him he sayde: Beholde, I haue take awaye thy synne from the, & wil decke the with chaunge of raymet.
{3:5} He sayde morouer: set a fayre myter vpon his heade. So they set a fayre myter vpon his heade, & put on clothes vpon him, and the angel of ye LORDE stode there.
{3:6} Then the angel of the LORDE testified vnto Iesua, & spake,
{3:7} thus sayeth the LORDE of hoostes: Yf thou wilt walke in my wayes, & kepe my watch: thou shalt rule my house, & kepe my courtes, & I wil geue the place amoge these that stonde here.
{3:8} Heare o Iesua thou hye prest, thou & thy frendes that dwell before the, for they are woderous people. Beholde, I will bringe forth the braunch of my seruaunt:
{3:9} for lo, the stone that I haue layed before Iesua: vpon one stone shalbe vij. eyes. Beholde, I will hewe him out (saieth the LORDE of hoostes) and take awaye the synne of that londe in one daye.
{3:10} Then shall euery man call for his neghboure, vnder the vyne & vnder ye fyge tre, saieth the LORDE of hoostes.
{4:1} And ye angel that talked with me, came agayne, & waked me vp (as a man that is raysed out of his slepe)
{4:2} & sayde vnto me: What seist thou? And I sayde: I haue loked, and beholde: a candelsticke all of golde, with a boll vpon it & his vij. lampes therin, & vpon euery lampe vij. stalkes:
{4:3} And ij. olyue trees therby, one vpon the right syde of the boll, & the other vpon the left syde.
{4:4} So I answered, & spake to the angel yt talked with me, sayenge: O my lorde what are these?
{4:5} The angel that talked with me, answered & sayde vnto me: knowest thou not what these be? And I sayde: No, my lorde.
{4:6} He answered, & sayde vnto me: This is the worde of the LORDE vnto Zorobabel, sayenge: Nether thorow an hoost of men, ner thorow stregth, but thorow my sprete, saieth ye LORDE of hoostes.
{4:7} What art thou (thou greate mountayne) before Zorobabel? thou must be made eauen. And he shal bringe vp the first stone, so that men shall crie vnto him: good lucke, good lucke.
{4:8} Morouer, the worde of the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{4:9} The hondes of Zorobabel haue layed ye foundacion of this house, his hondes also shal fynishe it: that ye maye knowe, how that the LORDE of hoostes hath sent me vnto you.
{4:10} For he that hath bene despysed a litle season, shal reioyce, whe he seyth the tynne weight in Zorobabels honde. The vij. eyes are the LORDES, which go thorow the hole worlde.
{4:11} Then answered I, & sayde vnto him: What are these two olyue trees vpon the right and left syde of the candilsticke?
{4:12} I spake morouer, & sayde vnto him: what be these ij. olyue braunches which (thorow ye two golden pipes) emptie them selues into the golde?
{4:13} He answered me, & sayde: knowest thou not, what these be? And I sayde: No, my lorde.
{4:14} Then sayde he: These are the two olyue braunches, that stonde before the ruler of the whole earth.
{5:1} So I turned me liftynge vp myne eyes, & loked, & beholde, a flyenge boke.
{5:2} And he sayde vnto me: what seist thou? I answered: I se a flyenge boke of xx. cubites longe & x. cubites brode.
{5:3} Then sayde he vnto me: This is the curse, yt goeth forth ouer the whole earth: For all theues shalbe iudged after this boke, & all swearers shalbe iudged acordinge to the same.
{5:4} I wil bringe it forth (saieth the LORDE of hoostes) so yt it shal come to the house of the thefe, & to the house of him, that falsely sweareth by my name: & shal remayne in his house, & cosume it, with the tymbre & stones therof.
{5:5} The the angel that talked with me, wente forth, & sayde vnto me: lift vp thine eyes & se, what this is yt goeth forth.
{5:6} And I sayde: what is it? He answered: this is a measure goinge out. He sayde morouer: Euen thus are they (yt dwell vpon the whole earth) to loke vpon.
{5:7} And beholde, there was lift vp a talent of leade: & lo, a woman sat in the myddest of the measure.
{5:8} And he sayde: This is vngodlynesse. So he cast her in to the myddest of the measure, & threwe ye lompe of leade vp in to an hole.
{5:9} Then lift I vp myne eyes, & loked: & beholde, there came out ij. women, & the wynde was in their wynges (for they had wynges like the wynges of a Storke) & they lift vp the measure betwixte the earth & the heauen.
{5:10} Then spake I to the angel, yt talked wt me: whyther wil these beare the measure?
{5:11} And he sayde vnto me: in to the londe of Synear, to buylde them an house: which when it is prepared, the measure shall be set there in his place.
{6:1} Morouer I turned me, liftynge vp myne eyes, & loked: & beholde, there came iiij. charettes out fro betwixte two hilles, which hilles were of brasse:
{6:2} In the first charet were reade horse, In the secode charet were blacke horse,
{6:3} In ye thirde charet were whyte horse, In ye fourth charet were horses of dyuerse colours, & stronge.
{6:4} Then spake I, and sayde vnto the angel that talked with me: O lorde, what are these?
{6:5} The angel answered, & sayde vnto me: These are the iiij. wyndes of the heauen, which be come forth to stode before the ruler of all ye earth.
{6:6} That with the blacke horse wente in to the londe of the north, & the whyte folowed the, and the sprekled horses wente forth towarde the south.
{6:7} These horses were very stronge, & wente out: and sought to go and take their iourney ouer the whole earth. And he sayde: get you hence, and go thorow the worlde. So they wete thorow out the worlde.
{6:8} Then cried he vpon me, and spake vnto me, sayenge: Beholde, these that go towarde ye north, shal still my wrath in the north countre.
{6:9} And the worde of the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{6:10} Take of the presoners that are come from Babilon: namely, Heldai, Tobias and Idaia: & come thou the same daye, and go into the house of Iosias the sonne of Sophony.
{6:11} Then take golde and syluer, and make crownes therof, and set them vpon the heade of Iesua the sonne of Iosedec, the hie prest,
{6:12} and speake vnto him: Thus saieth the LORDE of hoostes: Beholde, the man whose name is the braunch: & he that shall springe vp after him, shal buylde vp the temple of the LORDE:
{6:13} yee euen he shall buylde vp the temple of the LORDE. He shal beare the prayse, he shall syt vpon the LORDES trone, and haue the dominaciou. A prest shall he be also vpon his trone, & a peaceable councell shalbe betwixte them both.
{6:14} And the crownes shal be in the temple of the LORDE, for a remembraunce vnto Helem, Tobias, Idaia and Hen the sonne of Sophony. And soch as be farre of, shal come and buylde the temple of the LORDE:
{6:15} that ye maye knowe, how that the LORDE of hoostes hath sent me vnto you. And this shal come to passe, yf ye wil herken diligently vnto the voyce of the LORDE youre God.
{7:1} It happened also in the fourth yeare of kynge Darius, that the worde of the LORDE came vnto Zachary in the fourth daye of the ix. moneth, which is calleth Casleu:
{7:2} what tyme as Sarasar and Rogomelech and the men that were with them, sent vnto Bethel for to praye before ye LORDE:
{7:3} and that they shulde saye vnto the prestes, which were in the house of the LORDE of hoostes, and to the prophetes: Shulde I wepe in the fyfte moneth, and absteyne, as I haue done now certayne yeares?
{7:4} Then came the worde of the LORDE of hoostes vnto me, sayenge:
{7:5} Speake vnto all the people of the londe, and to the prestes, and saye: when ye fasted and mourned in the v & vij. moneth (now this lxx. yeares) dyd ye fast vnto me?
{7:6} When ye ate also and dronke, dyd ye not eate and drinke for youre owne selues?
{7:7} Are not these the wordes, which the LORDE spake by his prophetes afore tyme, when Ierusalem was yet inhabited and welthy, she and the cities rounde aboute her: when there dwelt me, both towarde the south and in the playne countrees?
{7:8} And the worde of the LORDE came vnto Zachary, sayenge:
{7:9} Thus saieth ye LORDE of hoostes: Execute true iudgment: shewe mercy and louynge kyndnesse, euery man to his brother:
{7:10} Do the wyddowe, the fatherlesse, the straunger, and poore no wronge: and let no man ymagen euell agaynst his brother in his hert.
{7:11} Neuertheles they wolde not take hede, but turned their backes, and stopped their eares, that they shulde not heare.
{7:12} yee they made their hertes as an Adamant stone, lest they shulde heare the lawe & wordes, which the LORDE of hoostes sent in his holy sprete by the prophetes afore tyme. Wherfore the LORDE of hoostes was very wroth at them.
{7:13} And thus is it come to passe, that like as he spake and they wolde not heare: euen so they cried, and I wolde not heare (saieth the LORDE of hoostes)
{7:14} but scatered them amonge all Gentiles, whom they knewe not. Thus the londe was made so desolate, yt there traualed no man in it nether to ner fro, for that pleasaunt londe was vtterly layed waist.
{8:1} So the worde of the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{8:2} Thus saieth the LORDE of hoostes: I was in a greate gelousy ouer Sion, yee I haue bene very gelous ouer her in a greate displeasure.
{8:3} thus saieth the LORDE of hoostes: I wil turne me agayne vnto Sion, and wil dwel in the myddest of Ierusalem: so that Ierusalem shalbe called a faithfull and true cite, the hill of the LORDE of hoostes, yee an holy hill.
{8:4} Thus saieth the LORDE of hoostes: There shall yet olde men and women dwel agayne in the stretes of Ierusalem: yee and soch as go with staues in their hondes for very age.
{8:5} The stretes of the cite also shalbe full of yonge boyes and damselles, playnge vpon the stretes.
{8:6} Thus saieth the LORDE of hoostes: yf the residue of this people thynke it to be vnpossible in these dayes, shulde it therfore be vnpossible in my sight, sayeth the LORDE of hoostes
{8:7} Thus saieth the LORDE of hoostes: Beholde, I wil delyuer my people from the londe of the east and west,
{8:8} and wil brynge them agayne: that they maye dwel at Ierusalem. They shalbe my people, and I will be their God, in treuth and rightuousnesse.
{8:9} Thus saieth the LORDE of hoostes: let youre hondes be stronge, ye that now heare these wordes by the mouth of the prophetes, which be in these dayes that the foundacion is layed vpon the LORDE of hoostes house, that the temple maye be buylded.
{8:10} For why? before these dayes nether men ner catel coude wynne eny thinge, nether might eny man come in and out in rest, for trouble: but I let euery man go agaynst his neghboure.
{8:11} Neuerthelesse I wil now intreate the residue of this people nomore, as afore tyme (saieth the LORDE of hoostes)
{8:12} but they shalbe a sede of peace. The vynyarde shal geue hir frute, the grounde shal geue hir increase, and the heauens shal geue their dew: and I shal cause the remnaunt of this people, to haue all these in possession.
{8:13} And it shall come to passe, that like as ye were a curse amonge the Heithen (O ye house of Iuda and ye house of Israel) Euen so wil I delyuer you, that ye shalbe a blessynge: feare not, but let youre hodes be stronge.
{8:14} For thus saieth the LORDE of hoostes: like as I deuysed to punysh you, what tyme as youre fathers prouoked me vnto wrath (sayeth the LORDE of hoostes) and spared not:
{8:15} Euen so am I determed now in these dayes, for to do wel vnto the house of Iuda and Ierusalem, therfore feare ye not.
{8:16} Now the thinges that ye shal do, are these: Speake euery man the treuth vnto his neghboure, execute iudgment truly and peaceably within youre portes,
{8:17} none of you ymagyn euell in his hert agaynst his neghboure, and loue no false oothes: for all these are the thinges that I hate, sayeth the LORDE.
{8:18} And the worde of the LORDE of hoostes came vnto me, sayenge:
{8:19} thus sayeth the LORDE of hoostes: The fast of the fourth moneth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seuenth, and the fast of the tenth, shal be ioye and gladnesse, & prosperous hye feastes vnto the house of Iuda: Only, loue the treuth and peace.
{8:20} Thus saieth the LORDE of hoostes: There shall yet come people, and the inhabiters of many cities:
{8:21} and they that dwell in one cite, shal go to another, sayenge: Vp, let vs go, and praye before the LORDE, let vs seke the LORDE of hoostes, I wil go with you.
{8:22} Yee moch people and mightie Heithen shal come and seke the LORDE of hoostes at Ierusalem, and to praye before the LORDE.
{8:23} Thus saieth the LORDE of hoostes: In that tyme shal ten men (out of all maner of languages of the Gentiles) take one Iewe by the hemme of his garment, and saye: we wil go with you, for we haue herde, that God is amonge you.
{9:1} The worde of the LORDE shalbe receaued at Adrach, & Damascus shalbe his offerynge: for the eyes of all me and of the trybes of Israel shall loke vp vnto the LORDE.
{9:2} The borders of Hemath shal be harde therby, Tyrus also & Sidon, for they are very wise.
{9:3} Tyrus shal make hirself stronge, heape vp syluer as the sonde, and golde as the claye of the stretes.
{9:4} Beholde, the LORDE shal take her in, and haue her in possession: he shal smyte downe hir power in to the see, and she shalbe consumed with fyre.
{9:5} This shal Ascalon se, and be afrayed. Gaza shalbe very sory, so shal Accaron also, because hir hope is come to confucion. For the kinge of Gaza shall perish, and at Ascalon shal no man dwel.
{9:6} Straugers shall dwel at Asdod, & as for ye pryde of ye Philistynes, I shal rote it out.
{9:7} Their bloude will I take awaye from their mouth, and their abhominacios from amonge their teth. Thus they shal be left for oure God, yee they shalbe as a prynce in Iuda, & Accaron like as Iebusi.
{9:8} And so will I compase my house rounde aboute with my men of warre, goinge to and fro: that no oppressoure come vpon them eny more. For that haue I sene now with myne eyes.
{9:9} Reioyce thou greatly, o doughter Sion: be glad, o doughter Ierusalem. For lo, thy kinge commeth vnto the, euen the rightuous and Sauioure: Lowly and symple is he, he rydeth vpon an asse, and vpo the foale of an asse.
{9:10} I wil rote out the charettes fro Ephraim, & the horse from Ierusalem, the batel bowes shal be destroyed. He shall geue the doctryne of peace vnto the Heithen, and his dominion shalbe from the one see to the other, & from the floudes to the endes of the worlde.
{9:11} Thou also thorow the bloude of thy couenaunt: shalt let thy presoners out of the pytte, wherin is no water.
{9:12} Turne you now to the stronge holde, ye that be in preson, & longe sore to be delyuered: And this daye I bringe the worde, that I wil rewarde the dubble agayne.
{9:13} For Iuda haue I bent out as a bowe for me, and Ephraim haue I fylled. Thy sonnes (o Sio) wil I rayse vp agaynst the Grekes, and make the as a giauntes swearde:
{9:14} the LORDE God shalbe sene aboue the, and his dartes shall go forth as the lightenynge. The LORDE God shall blowe the trompet, and shal come forth as a storme out of the south.
{9:15} The LORDE of hoostes shall defende the, they shall consume and deuoure, and subdue them with slynge stones. They shal drynke & rage, as it were thorow wyne. They shalbe fylled like ye basens, & as ye hornes of ye aulter.
{9:16} The LORDE their God shal delyuer the in ye daye, as the flock off his people: for the stones off his Sanctuary shalbe set vp in his lade.
{9:17} O how prosperous and goodly a thynge shall that be? The corne shall make the yongemen chearefull, and the new wyne the maydens.
{10:1} Praye the LORDE then by tymes to geue you the latter rayne, so shall the LORDE make cloudes, and geue you rayne ynough for all the increase off the felde:
{10:2} For vayne is the answere of Idols. The soythsayers se lyes, and tell but vayne dreames: the comforth that they geue, is nothynge worth. Therfore go they astraye like a flocke of shepe, ad are troubled, because they haue no shepherde.
{10:3} My wrothfull displeasure is moued at the shepherdes, and I will vyset the goates. For the LORDE of hoostes wil graciously vyset his flocke (the house of Iuda) and holde them as a goodly fayre horse in the batell.
{10:4} Out of Iuda shal come the helmet, the nale, the batelbowe, and all the princes together.
{10:5} They shalbe as the giauntes, which in the batell treade downe the myre vpon ye stretes. They shal fight, for ye LORDE shalbe with them, so that the horsmen shalbe confounded.
{10:6} I wil coforte the house of Iuda, and preserue the house of Ioseph. I wil turne them also, for I pytie them: and they shal be like as they were, when I had not cast them of. For I the LORDE am their God, and wil heare them.
{10:7} Ephraim shalbe as a giaunt, and their herte shalbe cherefull as thorow wyne: Yee their children shal se it, and be glad; and their herte shal reioyce in the LORDE.
{10:8} I wil blowe for them & gather them together, for I wil redeme them. They shall increace, as they increased afore.
{10:9} I wil sowe the amonge the people, yt they maye thinke vpo me in farre countrees: they shal lyue wt their childre, and turne agayne.
{10:10} I wil bringe them agayne also from the londe of Egipte, and gather them out of Assiria. I wil carye them in to ye londe of Galaad and to Libanus, and they shal wante nothynge.
{10:11} He shall go vpon the see of trouble, and smyte the see wawes: so yt all the depe floudes shalbe dryed vp. The proude boostinge of Assur shalbe cast downe, and the scepter off Egipte shall be taken awaye.
{10:12} I will comforte them in the LORDE, that they maye walke in his name, saieth the LORDE.
{11:1} Open thy dores (o Libanus) that the fyre maye consume thy Cedre trees.
{11:2} Howle ye Fyrre trees, for the Cedre is falle, yee all ye proude are waisted awaye Howle (o ye oke trees of Baasan) for ye mightie stronge wod is cut downe.
{11:3} Men maye heare the shepherdes mourne, for their glory is destroyed. Me maye heare the lyons whelpes roare, for the pryde off Iordane is waisted awaye.
{11:4} Thus sayeth the LORDE my God: Fede the shepe of ye slaughter,
{11:5} which shalbe slayne of those that possesse them: yet they take it for no synne, but they yt sell the, saye: The LORDE be thanked, I am rich: Yee their owne shepherdes spare them not.
{11:6} Therfore wil I nomore spare those that dwell in the londe (sayeth the LORDE) but lo, I will delyuer the people, euery man in to his neghbours honde, and in to the hode of his kynge: that they maye smyte the londe, and out off their hondes wil not I delyuer them.
{11:7} I myself fedde ye slaughter shepe (a poore flocke verely) ad toke vnto me two staues: the one I called louynge mekenesse, the other I called wo, and so I kepte the shepe.
{11:8} Thre shepherdes destroyed I in one moneth, for I might not awaye wt them, nether had they eny delyte in me.
{11:9} Then sayde I: I will fede you nomore, the thinge that dyeth, let it dye: and that wil perishe, let it perish, & let the renaunt eate, euery one the flesh of his neghboure.
{11:10} I toke also my louynge meke staff, ad brake it, that I might disanull the conuenaunt, which I made with all people,
{11:11} And so it was broken in that daye. Then the poore symple shepe that had a respecte vnto me, knewe therby, that it was the worde of the LORDE.
{11:12} And I sayde vnto them: yff ye thynke it good, brynge hither my pryce: yf no, then leaue. So they wayed downe xxx. syluer pens, ye value that I was prysed at.
{11:13} And the LORDE sayde vnto me: cast it vnto the potter (a goodly pryce for me to be valued at of them) and I toke the xxx. syluers pens, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORDE.
{11:14} Then brake I my other staff also (namely wo) that I might lowse the brotherheade betwixte Iuda and Israel.
{11:15} And the LORDE sayde vnto me: Take to the also the staff off a foolish shepherde:
{11:16} for lo, I will rayse vp a shepherde in the londe, which shall not seke after the thinges that be lost, ner care for soch as go astraye: he shall not heale the wounded, he shal not norish the thinge that is whole: but he shall eate the flesh off soch as be fat, and teare their clawes in peces.
{11:17} O Idols shepherde, that leaueth the flocke. The swerde shal come vpon his arme and vpon his right eye. His arme shalbe clene dried vp, and his right eye shalbe sore blynded.
{12:1} The heuy burthen which ye LORDE hath deuysed for Israel. Thus saieth the LORDE, which spred the heaues abrode, layde the foundacion of the earth, and geueth man ye breath of life:
{12:2} Beholde, I will make Ierusalem a cuppe of surfet, vnto all the people yt are rounde aboute her: Yee Iuda himself also shalbe in the sege agaynst Ierusalem.
{12:3} At the same tyme will I make Ierusalem an heuy stone for all people, so that all soch as lift it vp, shalbe toarne and rete, and all the people of the earth shalbe gathered together agaynst it.
{12:4} In that daye (sayeth ye LORDE) I wil make all horses abasshed, and those that ryde vpon them, to be out of their wyttes. I will open myne eyes vpon the house of Iuda, ad smyte all the horses of the people with blyndnesse.
{12:5} And the prynces of Iuda shall saye in their hertes: The inhabiters off Ierusalem shall geue me consolacion in the LORDE off hoostes their God.
{12:6} In that tyme will I make the prynces of Iuda like an hote burnynge ouen with wodd, and like a cresshet off fyre amonge the strawe: so that they shal cosume all the people roude aboute them, both vpon the right honde and the left. Ierusale also shalbe inhabited agayne: namely, in the same place where Ierusalem stondeth.
{12:7} The LORDE shall preserue the tentes off Iuda like as afore tyme: so that the glory of the house of Dauid and the glory of the cytesyns of Ierusalem, shalbe but litle regarded, in comparison off the glory off Iuda.
{12:8} In that daye shall the LORDE defende the citesyns of Ierusalem: so that the weakest then amonge them shalbe as Dauid: and the house of Dauid shalbe like as Gods house, and as the angell off the LORDE before them.
{12:9} At the same tyme will I go aboute to destroye all soch people as come agaynst Ierusalem.
{12:10} Morouer, vpon the house off Dauid and vpon the citesyns off Ierusalem, will I poure out the sprete of grace and prayer: so that they shal loke vpon me, whom they haue pearsed: and they shall bewepe him, as men mourne for their only begotten sonne: Yee and be sory for him, as men are sory for their first childe.
{12:11} Then shall there be a greate mournynge at Ierusalem, like as the lamentacion at Adremnon in the felde off Maggadon.
{12:12} And the londe shall bewayle, euery kynred by the selues: The kynred off the house of Dauid them selues alone, and their wyues by them selues:
{12:13} The kynred off the house of Nathan them selues alone, and their wyues by them selues: The kynred off the house of Leui the selues alone, and their wiues by them selues: The kynred of the house of Semei them selues alone, and their wyues by them selues:
{12:14} In like maner, all the other generacios, euerychone by them selues alone, and their wyues by them selues.
{13:1} In that tyme shall the house off Dauid and the citesyns off Ierusalem haue an open well, to wash of synne and vnclennesse.
{13:2} And then (sayeth the LORDE off hoostes) I will destroye the names of Idols out off the londe: so that they shal nomore be put in remembraunce. As for the false prophetes also and the vnclene sprete, I shall take them out of the londe:
{13:3} So that yf eny off them prophecy eny more, his owne father and mother that begat him, shall saye vnto him: Thou shalt dye, for thou speakest lyes vnder the name off the LORDE: Yee his owne father and mother that begat him, shall wounde him, when he prophecyeth.
{13:4} And then shall those prophetes be confounded, euery one off his vision when he prophecieth: nether shall they weere sack clothes eny more, to disceaue me withall.
{13:5} But he shall be fayne to saye: I am no prophet: I am an husbonde man, for so am I taught by Adam fro my youth vp.
{13:6} And yff it be sayde vnto him: How came these woundes then in thine hondes? He shall answere: Thus am I wounded in the house off myne owne frendes.
{13:7} Arise (o thou swearde) vpon my shepherde, and vpon the prynce of my people, sayeth the LORDE of hoostes: Smyte the shepherde and the shepe shalbe scatred abrode, and so will I turne myne honde to the litle ones.
{13:8} And it shal come to passe (sayeth the LORDE) that in all the londe two partes shalbe roted out, but the thirde parte shal remayne therin.
{13:9} And the same thirde parte wil I brynge thorow the fyre, and will clense them, as the syluer is clensed: Yee and trye them, like as golde is tryed. Then shall they call vpon my name, and I wil heare them: I wil saye: it is my people. And they shal saye: LORDE, my God.
{14:1} Beholde, the daye of the LORDE cometh, that thou shalt be spoyled and robbed:
{14:2} for I wil gather together all the Heithen, to fight agaynst Ierusalem: so that the cite shalbe wonne, the houses spoyled, and the women defyled. The half of the cite shal go awaye in to captiuyte, and the residue of the people shal not be caried out of the cite.
{14:3} After that shall the LORDE go forth to fight agaynst those Heithen, as men vse to fight in the daye of batell.
{14:4} The shall his fete stode vpo the mount oliuete, that lieth vpon the east syde of Ierusale. And ye mount olyuete shal cleue in two, eastwarde, & westwarde so yt there shal be a greate valley: & the halff mount shal remoue towarde the north, and the other half towarde the south.
{14:5} And ye shall fle vnto the valley of my hilles, for the valley off the hylles shal reach vnto Asal. Yee fle shall ye. like as ye fled for the earthquake in the dayes off Osias kynge of Iuda. And the LORDE my God shal come, and all sanctes with him.
{14:6} In that daye shal it not be light, but colde and frost.
{14:7} This shalbe that specyall daye, which is knowne vnto the LORDE: nether daye ner night, but aboute the euenynge tyme it shalbe light.
{14:8} In that tyme shall there waters of life runne out from Ierusalem: the half parte of them towarde the east see, ad the other half towarde the vttemost see, and shall continue both somer and wynter.
{14:9} And the LORDE himself shalbe kynge ouer all the earth. At that tyme shal there be one LORDE only, and his name shalbe but one.
{14:10} Men shal go aboute the whole earth, as vpon a felde: from Gibea to Remmon, and from ye south to Ierusalem. She shalbe set vp, and inhabited in hir place: From BenIamins porte, vnto the place of the first porte, and vnto ye corner porte: and from the tower of Hanael, vnto the kynges wyne presses.
{14:11} There shall men dwell, and there shal be nomore cursinge, but Ierusalem shalbe safely inhabited.
{14:12} This shalbe the plage, wherwith ye LORDE wil smyte all people, that haue fought agaynst Ierusalem: Namely, their flesh shall consume awaye, though they stonde vpon their fete: their eyes shall corruppe in their holes, and their tunge shal consume in their mouth.
{14:13} In that daye shall the LORDE make a greate sedicion amoge them, so that one ma shal take another by the honde, and laye his hondes vpon the hondes of his neghboure.
{14:14} Iuda shal fight also agaynst Ierusalem, ad the goodes of all the Heithen shalbe gathered together rounde aboute: golde and syluer and a very greate multitude off clothes.
{14:15} And so shal this plage go ouer horses, mules camels, asses and all the beastes that shall be in the hooste, like as yonder plage was.
{14:16} Euery one that remayueth then of all ye people, which came agaynst Ierusalem, shal go vp yearly, to worshipe the kynge (euen ye LORDE of hoostes) and to kepe the feast off tabernacles.
{14:17} And loke what generacion vpon earth goeth not vp to Ierusalem, for to worshipe the kynge (euen the LORDE of hoostes) vpon the same shal come no rayne.
{14:18} Yff the kynred of Egipte go not vp & come not, it shall not rayne vpon them nether. This shalbe the plage wherwith ye LORDE wil smyte all Heithen, that come not vp to kepe the feast of tabernacles:
{14:19} Yee this shalbe the synneplage of Egipte and the synneplage of all people, that go not vp to kepe the feast of tabernacles.
{14:20} At that tyme shal the rydinge geer of ye horses be holy vnto the LORDE, and the kettels in the LORDES house shal be like the basens before the aulter:
{14:21} yee all the kettels in Ierusalem and Iuda, shalbe holy vnto the LORDE of hoostes: and all they that slaye offeringes, shall come and take of them, and dight them therin. And at that tyme there shal be no mo Cananites in the house of the LORDE.

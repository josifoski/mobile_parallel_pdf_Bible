{12:15} These are they which in the fyrst moneth wente ouer Iordane, whan it was full on both the shores, so that all the valleys were eauen both towarde the East and towarde the West.
{12:16} There came of the children of BenIamin also and of Iuda vnto the castell of Dauid.
{12:17} But Dauid wente forth vnto them, and answered and sayde vnto them: Yf ye come to me in peace, and to helpe me, my hert shal be with you. But yf ye come vpo disceate, and to be mine aduersaries (where as there is yet no vnrighte in me) the God of oure fathers loke vpon it, and rebuke it.
{12:18} Neuertheles the sprete endued Amasai the captayne amonge thirtie, and he sayde: We are thine O Dauid, and holde with the thou sonne of Isai. Peace, peace be with the, peace be with thy helpers, for thy God helpeth the. Then Dauid receaued them, and made them captaynes ouer the men of warre.
{12:19} And of Manasses there fell certaine vnto Dauid, whan he came to the battayll with the Philistynes agaynst Saul, and helped them not, for the prynces of ye Philistynes counceled to let him go from them, and sayde: Yf he fell vnto his lorde Saul, it mighte cost vs oure neckes.
{12:20} Now wha he departed vnto Siclag, there fell vnto him of Manasses, Adna, Iosabad, Iediael, Michael, Iosabad, Elihu, Zilthai, heades ouer thousandes in Manasses.
{12:21} And they helped Dauid against the men of warre: for they were all valeaunt Worthies, and were captaynes ouer the hoost.
{12:22} And euery daye came there some to Dauid, to helpe him, till there was a greate hoost as an hoost of God.
{12:23} And this is the nombre of the heades harnessed vnto the warre, which came to Dauid vnto Hebron, for to turne the kyngdome of Saul vnto him, acordynge to the worde of the LORDE.

{12:37} From beyonde Iordane, of the Rubenites, Gaddites and the halfe trybe of Manasses, with all maner of weapens to the battayll, an hudreth and twentye thousande.
{12:38} All these men of warre, ready harnessed to the battayll, came with a whole hert vnto Hebron, to make Dauid kynge ouer all Israel. And all Israel besyde were of one hert, that Dauid shulde be made kynge.
{12:39} And there were they with Dauid thre dayes, eatynge and drynkynge: for their brethren had prepared for them.
{12:40} And soch neghbours as were aboute them vntyll Isachar, Zabulon and Nephtali, brought bred vpon Asses, Camels, Mules and oxen to eate: meel, fyges, rasens, wyne, oyle, oxen, shepe, very many: for there was ioye in Israel.
{13:1} And Dauid helde a councell with the captaynes ouer thousandes and ouer hundreds, and with all the prynces,
{13:2} and sayde vnto all the congregacion of Israel: Yf it lyke you, and yf it be of the LORDE oure God, let vs sende forth on euery syde to oure other brethren in all the countrees of Israel, and to the prestes and Leuites in the cities where they haue suburbes, yt they maye be gathered together vnto vs,
{13:3} and let vs fetch the Arke of oure God agayne vnto vs: for by Sauls tyme we axed after it.
{13:4} The sayde the whole cogregacion, that the same shulde be done, for it pleased all the people well.
{13:5} So Dauid gathered all Israel together from Sihor of Egipte, tyll a man come vnto Hemath, to fetch the Arke of God from Kiriath Iearim.
{13:6} And Dauid wente vp wt all Israel to Kiriath Iearim, which lieth in Iuda, to brynge from thence the Arke of God the LORDE, that sytteth vpo the Cherubins, where the name is named:
{13:7} and they caused the Arke of God to be caried vpo a new cart from the house of Abinadab. Vsa and his brethren droue the cart.
{13:8} As for Dauid and all Israel, they played with all their strength before God, with songes, with harpes, with psalteries, with tabrettes, with Cymbales and trompes.
{13:9} But whan they came to the barne floore of Chidon, Vsa stretched out his hande to holde the Arke: for the oxen wente out asyde.
{13:10} Then waxed the wrath of the LORDE fearce ouer Vsa, & smote him, because he stretched out his hade to the Arke, so yt he dyed there before God.
{13:11} The was Dauid sory, because ye LORDE had made soch a rente vpo Vsa, and called the place Perez Vsa, vnto this daye.
{13:12} And Dauid stode in feare of God the same daye, & sayde: How shal I brynge ye Arke of God vnto me?
{13:13} Therfore wolde he not let ye Arke of God be broughte vnto him in to ye cite of Dauid, but caried it in to ye house of Obed Edom the Gathite.
{13:14} So the Arke of God abode with Obed Edom in his house thre monethes. And ye LORDE blessed Obed Edoms house and all that he had.
{14:1} And Hiram ye kynge of Tyre sent messaungers vnto Dauid and Cedre tymber, and masons and carpenters, to buylde him an house.
{14:2} And Dauid perceaued, that the LORDE had confirmed him kynge ouer Israel: for his kyngdome increased for his people of Israels sake.
{14:3} And Dauid toke yet mo wyues at Ierusalem, & begat yet mo sonnes & doughters.
{14:4} And the names of them yt were borne vnto him at Ierusalem, are these: Sammua, Sobab, Nathan, Salomon,
{14:5} Iebehar, Elisua, Elipalet,
{14:6} Noga, Nepheg, Iaphia,
{14:7} Elisamma, Baal Iada, Eliphalet.
{14:8} And whan the Philistynes herde that Dauid was anoynted kynge ouer all Israel, they wente vp all to seke Dauid. Whan Dauid herde that, he wente forth agaynst them.
{14:9} And the Philistynes came, and scatered the selues beneth in ye valley of Rephaim.
{14:10} And Dauid axed councell at God, & sayde: Shal I go vp agaynst the Philistynes? and wilt thou delyuer them in to my hande? The LORDE sayde vnto him: Go vp, and I wil delyuer them in to thy hande.
{14:11} And whan they were gone vp to Baal Prasim, Dauid smote them there. And Dauid sayde: God hath deuyded myne enemies thorow my hande, euen as the water parteth asunder: therfore called they the place Baal Prasim.
{14:12} And there lefte they their goddes. Then commaunded Dauid to burne them with fyre.
{14:13} But the Philistynes gat them thither agayne, and scatered them selues beneth in ye valley.
{14:14} And Dauid axed councell at God agayne. And God sayde vnto him: Thou shalt not go vp behynde them, but turne the from them, that thou mayest come vpon the ouer agaynst the Peertrees.
{14:15} So whan thou hearest aboue vpon the Peertrees the noyse of the goynge, go thou forth then to the batayll: for God is gone forth then before the to smyte the hoost of the Philistynes.
{14:16} And Dauid dyd as God commaunded him. And they smote the hoost of the Philistynes from Gibeon forth vnto Gaser.
{14:17} And Dauids name was noysed out in all londes. And the LORDE caused ye feare of him to come vpo all the Heythen.
{15:1} And he buylded him houses in the cite of Dauid, & made ready a place for ye Arke of God, & pitched a Tabernacle for it.
{15:2} At that tyme sayde Dauid: The Arke of God is not to be borne, but onely of ye Leuites: for them hath the LORDE chosen to beare the Arke of the LORDE, and to mynister vnto him for euer.
{15:3} Therfore gathered Dauid all Israel together vnto Ierusalem, to brynge vp the Arke of the LORDE vnto the place which he had prepared for it.
{15:4} And Dauid broughte the children of Aaron & the Leuites together.
{15:5} Of the children of Kahath: Vriel the chefe wt his brethren, an C. and twentye.
{15:6} Of the children of Merari: Asaia the chefe wt his brethre, two C. and twentye.
{15:7} Of the childre of Gerson: Ioel the chefe wt his brethren, an C. and thirtie.
{15:8} Of ye childre of Elizaphan: Semaia the chefe wt his brethren, two hundreth.
{15:9} Of the childre of Hebron: Eliel the chefe, with his brethre, foure score.
{15:10} Of the children of Vsiel: Amminadab the chefe, with his brethren, an hudreth and twolue.
{15:11} And Dauid called Sadoc and Abiathar the prestes, and the Leuites, namely Vriel, Asaia, Ioeli, Semaia, Eliel, Aminadab,
{15:12} and sayde vnto them: Ye are the heades of ye fathers amonge the Leuites: sanctifye yor selues therfore & youre brethre, yt ye maye brynge vp the Arke of the LORDE God of Israel, to the place yt I haue prepared for it.
{15:13} For a fore whan ye were not there, the LORDE oure God made a rent amonge vs, because we soughte him not, as we shulde haue done.
{15:14} So ye prestes & the Leuites halowed the selues, yt they mighte brynge vp the Arke of the LORDE God of Israel.
{15:15} And the children of Leui bare the Arke of God the LORDE vpon their shulders with the staues theron, as Moses comaunded acordinge to ye worde of the LORDE.
{15:16} And Dauid spake vnto ye rulers of ye Leuites, that they shulde ordeyne some of their brethren to be syngers with psalteries, harpes and loude instrumentes, and Cimbales, to synge loude with ioye.
{15:17} Then the Leuites appoynted Heman ye sonne of Ioel: and of his brethren Assaph the sonne of Barachias: and of the children of Merari their brethren, Ethan the sonne of Cusaia:
{15:18} and with them their brethren of the seconde course, namely Zacharias, Iaesiel, Semiramoth, Iehiel, Vnni, Eliab, Benaia, Maeseia, Mathithia, Elipheleia, Mikneia, Obed Edom, Ieiel, the dore kepers.
{15:19} For Heman, Assaph and Ethan were syngers, with brasen belles makynge a loude noyse:
{15:20} but Zacharias, Iaesiel, Semiramoth, Iehiel, Vnni, Eliab, Maeseia & Benaia with Phalteries to Alamoth:
{15:21} Mathithia, Elipheleia, Mikneia, Obed Edom, Ieiel & Asasia with harpes to synge aboue them on hye.
{15:22} Chenania the ruler of the Leuites was the master of Musick to teach them for to synge, for he was a man of vnderstondinge.
{15:23} And Barachias and Elcana were the dorekepers of the Arke.
{15:24} But Sachania, Iosaphat, Nathaneel, Amasai, Zacharias, Benaia, Elieser the prestes, blewe the trompettes before ye Arke of God. And Obed Edom and Iehia were dorekepers of the Arke.
{15:25} So Dauid and the Elders of Israel, and the captaynes ouer thousandes wente vp to fetch the Arke of the couenaunt of the LORDE out of the house of Obed Edom wt ioye.
{15:26} And whan God had helped the Leuites yt bare the Arke of the LORDES couenaunt, there were offred seuen bullockes & seuen rames,
{15:27} And Dauid had a lynne garment vpo him, and so had all the Leuites yt bare the Arke, and ye syngers, and Chenania the master of Musick wt the syngers. Dauid had an ouerbody cote of lynnen vpon him also.
{15:28} Thus all Israel brought vp the Arke of the couenaunt of the LORDE with myrth, with trompettes, tabrettes, & loude Cymbales, with psalteries and harpes.
{15:29} Now whan the Arke of the couenaunt of the LORDE came in to the cite of Dauid, Michol ye doughter of Saul loked out at a wyndowe: & wha she sawe kynge Dauid daunsynge & playenge, she despysed him in hir hert.
{16:1} And wha they brought in the Arke of God, they set it in ye Tabernacle, that Dauid had pitched for it, and offred burntofferynges & thankofferynges before God.
{16:2} And wha Dauid had ended the burntofferynges and thankofferynges, he blessed the people in the name of the LORDE,
{16:3} & distributed vnto euery man in Israel (both vnto man and woman) a cake of bred, and a pece of flesh and a meece of potage.
{16:4} And he appoynted before the Arke of ye LORDE certayne Leuites to mynister, that they shulde geue prayse, thankes and loauinges vnto the LORDE God of Israel:
{16:5} namely Assaph the first, Zacharias the seconde, Ieiel, Semiramoth, Iehiel, Mathithia, Eliab, Benaia, Obed Edom and Iehiel, with psalteries and harpes. But Assaph with loude Cymbales.
{16:6} Benaia and Iehasiel the prestes with tabrettes, allwaye before the Arke of ye couenaunt of God.
{16:7} At the same tyme ordeyned Dauid first of all to geue thakes vnto the LORDE by Assaph and his brethren.
{16:8} O geue thankes vnto the LORDE, call vpon his name, tell the people what thinges he hath done.
{16:9} O let youre songes be of him: prayse him, and let youre talkynge be of all his wonderous workes.
{16:10} Geue his holy name a good reporte: let ye hert of them reioyce, that seke the LORDE.
{16:11} O seke the LORDE and his strength, seke his face euermore.
{16:12} Remebre his maruelous workes that he hath done, his wonders, and the iudgmetes of his mouth.
{16:13} Ye sede of Israel his seruaunt, ye children of Iacob his chosen.
{16:14} He is the LORDE oure God, his iudgmetes are in all londes.
{16:15} Be myndefull euer of his couenaut what he hath commaunded in to a thousande generacions.
{16:16} Which he made with Abraham, & his ooth vnto Isaac.
{16:17} And he comfirmed the same vnto Iacob for a perpetuall lawe, and to Israel for an euerlastinge couenaunt.
{16:18} And sayde: Vnto the wyl I geue ye londe of Canaan, ye metelyne of yor inheritaunce.
{16:19} Wha they were yet but small & fewe in nobre, and straungers in the same londe.
{16:20} And they wente from one nacion to another, & from one realme to another people.
{16:21} He suffred no man to hurte them, and reproued euen kynges for their sakes.
{16:22} Touch not myne anoynted, & do my prophetes no harme.
{16:23} O synge vnto ye LORDE, let all ye earth be tellynge of his saluacion from daye to daye.
{16:24} Declare his holynes amoge the Heythe, & his wonderous workes amonge ye people.
{16:25} For the LORDE is greate, and can not worthely be praysed, and more to he had in awe then all goddes.
{16:26} As for all the goddes of the Heythe, they are but Idols: but it is the LORDE that made the heauens.
{16:27} Thankesgeuynge and worshipe are before him, strength and ioye is in his place.
{16:28} Ascrybe vnto the LORDE ye kynreds of nacions: ascrybe vnto the LORDE worshipe and strength.
{16:29} Ascrybe vnto the LORDE the honoure of his name: brynge presentes, and come before him, and worshipe ye LORDE in ye bewtye of holynes.
{16:30} Let the whole earth stode in awe of him: he hath made the compase of the worlde so fast, that it can not be moued.
{16:31} Let the heauens reioyse, and let the earth be glad: and let it be tolde amonge the Heythen, that the LORDE reigneth.
{16:32} Let the See make a noyse, and the fulnesse therof: let the felde be ioyfull, and all that therin is.
{16:33} Let all the trees in the wod leape for ioye before the LORDE, for he commeth to iudge the earth.
{16:34} O geue thankes vnto the LORDE, for he is gracious: and his mercy endureth for euer.
{16:35} And saye: Helpe vs O God oure Sauioure, and gather vs together, and delyuer vs from the Heythen, that we maye geue thankes vnto yi holy name, and synge prayses vnto the in thy Psalmes.
{16:36} Praysed be the LORDE God of Israel from euerlastinge to euerlastinge: and let all people saye, Amen, And: Prayse be vnto the LORDE.
{16:37} So he lefte Assaph and his brethren there before the Arke of the couenaunt of the LORDE, to mynister allwaye before the Arke, euery daye his daye worke.
{16:38} But Obed Edom and their brethren, eight and thre score, and Obed Edom the sonne of Iedithun, and Hossa, to be dore kepers.
{16:39} And Sadoc ye prest, & his brethre the prestes, lefte he before the habitacion of the LORDE vpon the hye place at Gibeo,
{16:40} to offre burntsacrifices daylie vnto the LORDE vpon the altare of burntofferynges in the mornynge & in the euenynge, as it is wrytten in the lawe of the LORDE, which he comaunded vnto Israel.
{16:41} And with them Heman & Iedithun, and ye other chosen, which were named by name to geue thankes vnto the LORDE, because his mercy endureth for euer.
{16:42} And with them Heman & Iedithun to stryke vpon the tabrettes and Cymbales, and the musicall instrumentes of God. As for the childre of Iedithun, he made them dorekepers.
{16:43} So all the people departed, euery one to his house: and Dauid returned also to blesse his house.
{17:1} It fortuned wha Dauid dwelt in his house, he sayde vnto ye prophet Nathan: Beholde, I dwell in a house of Ceder, and the Arke of the couenaunt of the LORDE is amonge the curtaynes.
{17:2} Nathan saide vnto Dauid: What so euer is in thine hert, that do: for God is with ye.
{17:3} But the same night came ye worde of God vnto Nathan, and sayde:
{17:4} Go and speake to Dauid my seruaunt: Thus sayeth the LORDE: Thou shalt not buylde me an house to be an habitacio:
{17:5} for I haue dwelt in no house sence the daye that I broughte forth the children of Israel, vnto this daye: But where the Tabernacle and habitacion hath bene, there haue I bene where so euer
{17:6} I haue walked in all Israel. Spake I euer to eny of the Iudges in Israel (whom I commaunded to kepe my people) and sayde: Wherfore do ye not buylde me an house of Cedre tymber?
{17:7} So shalt thou speake now vnto my seruaunt Dauid: Thus sayeth the LORDE Zebaoth: I toke the from the pasture behynde the shepe, that thou shuldest be the prynce ouer my people,
{17:8} and haue bene with the whither so euer thou wetest, and haue roted out all thine enemies before the, and haue made the a name, acordinge to the name of the greate men that are vpo earth.
{17:9} And for my people of Israel, I wyll appoynte them a place, and wyl plante them, that they maye dwell there, and nomore to be remoued. And the childre of wickednes shal oppresse them nomore,
{17:10} like as afore tyme, whan I comaunded the Iudges ouer my people of Israel. And I wyl subdue all thine enemies, and do declare vnto the, that the LORDE wyl buylde the an house.
{17:11} But whan thy dayes are fulfilled, that thou departest hence with yi fathers, I wyl after the rayse vp yi sede, which shall be eue one of thy sonnes: his kyngdome wyl I stablisshe,
{17:12} he shal buylde me an house, & I wyl make his seate sure for euer.
{17:13} I wyl be his father, and he shal be my sonne. And I wyl not withdrawe my mercy from him, as I haue withdrawen it fro him that was before the:
{17:14} But I wyll set him in my house and in my kyngdome for euer, so that his seate shalbe sure for euermore.
{17:15} And wha Nathan had spoken vnto Dauid acordinge to all these wordes & all this vision,
{17:16} kynge Dauid came and sat him downe before the LORDE, and sayde: O LORDE God, who am I? and what is my house, yt thou hast broughte me thus farre?
{17:17} And this (O God) hast thou thoughte yet to litle, but hast spoken of thy seruauntes house yet longe for to come. And thou LORDE God hast loked downe vpon me from aboue, euen as one man loketh vpon another.
{17:18} What more shal Dauid saye vnto the, yt thou bryngest yi seruaunt to soch honoure? Thou knowest thy seruaunt
{17:19} O LORDE, for thy seruauntes sake and acordinge to thy hert hast thou done all these greate thinges, that thou mightest shewe all greate thinges vnto thy seruaunt.
{17:20} LORDE, there is none lykel the, and there is no God but thou, of whom we haue herde with oure eares.
{17:21} And where is there a people vpon earth as thy people of Israel, where God wente to delyuer him a people, and to make him selfe a name thorow greate & terrible thinges, to cast out the Heythen before thy people, whom thou hast delyuered out of Egipte?
{17:22} and ye people of Israel hast thou made yi people for euer, and thou LORDE art become their God.
{17:23} Now LORDE, let the worde be verified for euer, that thou hast spoken ouer thy seruaunt and ouer his house, & do as thou hast spoken:
{17:24} and let thy name endure and be magnified for euer, that it maye sayde: The LORDE Zebaoth, the God of Israel is the God in Israel, and that the house of thy seruaunt Dauid maye be stablysshed before the:
{17:25} for thou LORDE hast opened the eare of yi seruaunt, that thou wilt buylde him an house. Therfore hath thy seruaunt founde (confydence) to make his prayer before the.
{17:26} Now LORDE, thou art God, and hast promysed soch good vnto thy seruaunt.
{17:27} Begynne now to blesse the house of thy seruaunt, that it maye be euermore before the: for loke what thou blessest (O LORDE) the same is blessed for euer.
{18:1} After this smote Dauid the Philistynes, and subdued them, and toke Gath & the vyllages therof out of the hande of the Philistynes.
{18:2} He smote the Moabites likewyse, so that the Moabites were subdued vnto Dauid, and gaue him trybute.
{18:3} He smote Hadad Eser also ye kynge of Zoba in Hemath, whan he wente to set vp his power by the water Euphrates.
{18:4} And Dauid toke from him a thousande charettes, seuen thousande horsmen, and twetye thousande fote men. And Dauid lamed all the charettes, and kepte an hundreth charettes ouer.
{18:5} And the Syrias came from Damascon, to helpe Hadad Eser the kynge of Zoba. Howbeit Dauid smote two & twentie thousande of the same Syrians,
{18:6} and layed men of warre at Damascon in Syria, so that the Syrians were subdued vnto Dauid, and broughte him trybute. For the LORDE helped Dauid, whither so euer he wente.
{18:7} And Dauid toke the shyldes of golde, yt Hadad Esers seruautes had, & broughte the to Ierusale.
{18:8} And out of Tibehath & Chun the cities of Hadad Eser, toke Dauid very moch brasse, wherof Salomon made the brasen lauer, and pilers, and brasen vessels.
{18:9} And wha Thogu the kynge of Hemath herde, yt Dauid had smytten all ye power of Hadad Eser,
{18:10} he sent his sonne Hadora vnto kynge Dauid, to salute him & to blesse him, because he had foughte wt Hadad Eser, & smytte hi (for Thogu had warre wt Hadad Eser) and all the same vessels of golde, syluer and of brasse,
{18:11} dyd kynge Dauid consecrate vnto the LORDE, with the syluer and golde that he had taken from the Heythe, namely, from the Edomites, Moabites, Ammonites, Philistynes, and Amalechites.
{18:12} And Abisai the sonne of Zeru Ia smote eightene thousande of the Edomites in the Salt valley,
{18:13} and layed me of warre in Edomea, so that all the Edomites were subdued vnto Dauid: for ye LORDE helped Dauid, whither so euer he wente.
{18:14} Thus Dauid reigned ouer all Israel, and executed iudgment and righteousnes vnto all the people.
{18:15} Ioab the sonne of Zeru Ia was captayne ouer the hoost. Iosaphat the sonne of Ahilud was Chaunceler.
{18:16} Sadoc the sonne of Achitob, and Ahimelech ye sonne of Abiathar, were prestes. Sauesa was Scrybe.
{18:17} Benaia the sonne of Ioiada was ouer the Chrethians & Plethians. And Dauids sonnes were chefe at ye kynges hande.
{19:1} And after this dyed Nahas ye kynge of the childre of Ammon, and his sonne was kynge in his steade.
{19:2} Then sayde Dauid: I wil do mercy vpon Hanun the sonne of Nahas, for his father dyd mercy vpon me: and so he sent messaungers to comforte him ouer his father. And wha Dauids seruauntes came in to the londe of the children of Ammon vnto Hanun to comforte him,
{19:3} the prynces of the children of Ammon sayde vnto Hanun: Thinkest thou that Dauid honoureth thy father in thy sighte, that he hath sent coforters vnto the? Yee his seruauntes are come vnto the, to search and to ouerthrowe, and to spye out the londe.
{19:4} Then toke Hanun the seruauntes of Dauid, and shoue them, & cut the halfe of their garmentes of, eue by the loynes, & so let the go.
{19:5} And they wente their waye, & sent men to tell Dauid. Neuertheles he sent to mete them (for ye men were put to greate shame) and the kynge sayde: Abyde at Iericho, tyll youre beerdes be growne, and then come agayne.
{19:6} Whan the childre of Ammon sawe, that they stynked in ye sighte of Dauid, both Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousande taletes of syluer, to hyre charettes and horsmen out of Mesopotamia, out of Maecha and out of Zoba:
{19:7} and hyred two and thirtie thousande charettes, & ye kynge of Maecha with his people, which came & pitched their tentes before Medba. And the children of Ammon gathered them selues together out of their cities, and came to the battayll.
{19:8} Whan Dauid herde that, he sent Ioab thither with all the hoost of the men of armes.
{19:9} And the childre of Ammon were gone forth, and prepared them selues to the battayll before the gate of the cite. But the kynges yt were come, kepte them asyde in the felde.
{19:10} Now wha Ioab sawe that the battayll was agaynst him both before and behynde, he chose of all the best yonge men in Israel, and prepared him selfe agaynst ye Syrians.
{19:11} As for ye residue of the people, he put them vnder the hande of Abisai his brother, that they shulde prepare them selues agaynst the children of Ammon,
{19:12} and he sayde: Yf ye Syrias be to mightie for me, helpe thou me: but yf the childre of Ammon be to stroge for ye, I shall helpe the:
{19:13} take a good corage vnto the, and let vs quyte oure selues manly for oure people and for the cities of oure God: neuertheles the LORDE do what pleaseth him.
{19:14} And Ioab made him forth with ye people that was with him, to fighte agaynst ye Syrians: & they fled before him.
{19:15} And whan the children of Ammon sawe yt the Syrians fled, they fled also before Abisai his brother, and wente in to the cite. And Ioab came to Ierusalem.
{19:16} But whan the Syrians sawe that they were smytte before Israel, they sent messaungers, and broughte forth ye Syrians which were beyonde the water. And Sophach the chefe captayne of Hadad Eser wente before them.
{19:17} Wha this was tolde Dauid, he gathered all Israel together, and wente ouer Iordane. And whan he came at them, he set ye battayll in araye agaynst them. And Dauid prepared him selfe to ye battayll agaynst ye Syrians, & they foughte with him:
{19:18} but ye Syrias fled before Israel. And Dauid slewe of the Syrians seuen thousande charettes, & fortye thousande fote men. And Sophach the chefe captayne slewe he also.
{19:19} And whan Hadad Esers seruauntes sawe that they were smytte before Israel, they made peace wt Dauid & his seruauntes. And the Syrians wolde helpe the childre of Ammon nomore.
{20:1} And whan ye yeare came aboute, what tyme as ye kynges vse to go forth, Ioab broughte the power of the hoost, & destroyed the londe of the children of Ammon, and came and layed sege vnto Rabba. But Dauid abode at Ierusalem. And Ioab smote Rabba, and brake it downe.
{20:2} And Dauid toke their kynges crowne from his heade, and founde the weighte of a talent of golde theron, & precious stones. And it was set vpo Dauids heade. And very moch spoyle caried he out of the cite.
{20:3} As for the people that were therin, he broughte the forth, & parted them in sunder wt sawes, & hokes & betels of yron. Thus dyd Dauid vnto all ye cities of the childre of Ammon. And Dauid departed againe, with the people vnto Ierusalem.
{20:4} Afterwarde arose there warre at Gasar with the Philistynes. Then Sibechai ye Husathite smote Sibai, which was one of the children of Rephaim, and he subdued him.
{20:5} And there arose warre agayne wt the Philistynes. The Elhamah ye sonne of Iair smote Lahemi ye brother of Goliath ye Gathite, whose speares staff was life a weeuers lome.
{20:6} Afterwarde was there a battayll at Gath, where there was a man of a greate stature, yt had sixe fyngers and sixe toes, which make foure and twentye. And he was borne also of Rapha, and spake despytefully vnto Israel.
{20:7} But Ionathas the sonne of Simea Dauids brother smote him.
{20:8} These were the childre of Rapha at Gath, & fell thorow ye hande of Dauid, and of his seruauntes.
{21:1} And Sathan stode agaynst Israel, & entysed Dauid to nombre Israel.
{21:2} And Dauid sayde vnto Ioab & to ye rulers of the people: Go yor waye, nombre Israel from Berseba vnto Dan, and brynge me the nombre of the, that I maye knowe it.
{21:3} Ioab sayde: The LORDE make his people an hundreth tymes mo then they are now. But my lorde O kynge, are they not all my lordes seruauntes? Why doth my lorde then axe therafter? Wherfore shal there a trespace come vpon Israel?
{21:4} Neuertheles the kynges worde preuayled agaynst Ioab. And Ioab wente forth, and walked thorow all Israel, and came to Ierusalem,
{21:5} and delyuered vnto Dauid ye nombre of the people that was tolde. And of all Israel there were a thousande tymes a thousande, and an hundreth thousande men, that drue out the swerde: and of Iuda foure hundreth thousande and seuetye thousande men, which drue out the swerde.
{21:6} As for Leui and Ben Iamin, he nombred them not amonge these: for the kynges worde was abhominable vnto Ioab.
{21:7} But this displeased God righte sore: for he smote Israel.
{21:8} And Dauid sayde vnto God: I haue synned greuously, that I haue done this. But now take awaye the trespace of thy seruaunt: for I haue done very vnwysely.
{21:9} And the LORDE spake vnto Gad Dauids Seer, & sayde:
{21:10} Go speake to Dauid, & saye: Thus saieth the LORDE: Thre thinges laye I before the, chose ye one of them, yt I maye do it vnto the.
{21:11} And wha Gad came to Dauid, he spake vnto him: Thus sayeth the LORDE: Chose ye
{21:12} ether thre yeare derth, or thre monethes to flye before thine aduersaries, & before the swerde of thine enemies, yt it maye ouertake the: or thre dayes ye swerde of the LORDE, & pestilece in the londe, yt the angell of the LORDE maye destroye in all ye coastes of Israel. Loke now what answere I shal geue vnto him yt sent me.
{21:13} Dauid sayde vnto Gad: I am in greate trouble: yet wyl I rather fall in to ye hande of the LORDE, for his mercy is exceadynge greate, & I wil not fall in to the handes of men.
{21:14} Then dyd the LORDE cause pestilence to come into Israel, so that there fell of Israel thre score & ten thousande me.
{21:15} And God sent the angell to Ierusale for to destroye it. And euen in the destruccion the LORDE considered, and he repeted of the euell, and sayde vnto the angell ye destroyer: It is ynough, holde now thy hande. The angell of the LORDE stode besyde ye barne of Arnan ye Iebusite.
{21:16} And Dauid lifte vp his eyes, and sawe the angell of ye LORDE stondinge betwene heaue and earth, and a naked swerde in his hande stretched out ouer Ierusalem. Then Dauid and ye Elders beynge clothed with sack cloth, fell vpo their faces.
{21:17} And Dauid sayde vnto God: Am not I he that caused the people to be nombred? I am he that hath synned and done euell: as for these shepe, what haue they done? LORDE my God, let thine hande be agaynst me and agaynst my fathers house, and not agaynst thy people to plage them.
{21:18} And the angell sayde vnto Gad, that he shulde speake vnto Dauid, that Dauid shulde shulde go vp, & set vp an altare in the barne of Arnan the Iebusite.
{21:19} So Dauid wente vp acordinge to ye worde of Gad, which he spake in the name of the LORDE.
{21:20} But wha Arnan turned him, and sawe the angell (and his foure sonnes with him) they hyd the selues: for Arnan throsshed wheate.
{21:21} Now whan Dauid came to Arnan, Arnan loked, and was aware of Dauid, and wete forth out of the barne, and worshipped Dauid with his face to the grounde.
{21:22} And Dauid sayde vnto Arnan: Geue me rowme in the barne, to buylde an altare vnto the LORDE therin: for ye full money shalt thou geue it me, that the plage maye ceasse from the people.
{21:23} But Arnan sayde vnto Dauid: Take it vnto the, and let my lorde the kynge do as pleaseth him. Beholde, that oxe geue I for a burntofferynge, and those vessels to the oxe, and wheate for the meatofferynge, I geue it all.
{21:24} Neuertheles the kynge sayde vnto Arnan: Not so, but for ye full money wyl I bye it: for that which is thine wyl not I take for the LORDE, and offre a burntofferynge for naughte.
{21:25} So Dauid gaue Arnan for ye rowme, sixe hundreth Sycles of golde in weight.
{21:26} And there buylded Dauid an altare vnto ye LORDE, & offred burntofferynges & slaynofferynges. And whan he called vpo the LORDE, he herde him thorow the fyre from heaue vpon ye altare of the burntofferynge.
{21:27} And ye LORDE sayde vnto the angell, that he shulde put his swerde in to his sheeth.
{21:28} At the same tyme wha Dauid sawe, that the LORDE had herde him vpon the corne floore of Arnan ye Iebusite, he dyd sacrifice there.
{21:29} For ye habitacion of ye LORDE which Moses had made in the wyldernes, and the altare of burntofferynges, was at that tyme in the hye place at Gibeon.
{21:30} But Dauid coulde not go thither to seke God before it, for he feared the swerde of the LORDES angell.
{22:1} And Dauid sayde: Here shal be ye house of God ye LORDE, and this the altare of burntofferynges for Israel.
{22:2} And Dauid comaunded to gather together the straungers that were in ye londe of Israel, and appoynted masons to hewe stone for the buyldinge of the house of God.
{22:3} And Dauid prepared moch yron for nales in the dores of the portes, and for soch thinges as were to be naled together, and so moch brasse, that is was not to be weyed:
{22:4} and Cedre trees innumerable: for they of Zidon & Tyre brought Dauid moch Cedre tymbre:
{22:5} for Dauid thoughte, Salomo my sonne is but a childe and tender: But the house that shal be buylded vnto the LORDE, shal be greate, that his name & prayse maye be exalted in all londes, therfore wyl I prouyde for him. So Dauid made greate prouysion before his death.
{22:6} And he called Salomon his sonne, & commaunded him to buylde the house of LORDE God of Israel,
{22:7} and sayde vnto him: My sonne, I was minded to buylde an house vnto the name of the LORDE my God,
{22:8} but the worde of ye LORDE came vnto me, and sayde: Thou hast shed moch bloude, and strycken many battayls, therfore shalt thou not buylde an house vnto my name, for as moch as thou hast shed so moch bloude vpon the earth before me.
{22:9} Beholde, the sonne which shal be borne vnto the, shal be a quyete man: and I wyl cause him to be in rest from al his enemies on euery syde, for his name shalbe Salomon: for I wyll geue peace and rest vpon Israel as longe as he lyueth.
{22:10} He shal buylde an house vnto my name. He shal be my sonne, and I wyll be his father. And I wyl stablyshe ye seate of his kyngdome vpo Israel for euer.
{22:11} Now my sonne, the LORDE shal be wyth the, and thou shalt prospere, that thou mayest buylde an house vnto the LORDE thy God, acordynge as he hath spoken of the.
{22:12} The LORDE also shal geue the wysdome & vnderstondynge, and shal commytte Israel vnto the, that thou mayest kepe the lawe of the LORDE thy God.
{22:13} But then shal thou prospere, yf thou take hede to do after the ordynaunces and lawes which the LORDE commaunded Moses vnto Israel. Be stronge, and take a good corage vnto the, feare not, and be not faynt harted.
{22:14} Beholde, I haue in my pouerte prouyded for the house of the LORDE, an hundreth thousande talentes of golde, and a thousande tymes a thousande talentes of syluer, and brasse and yron without nombre: for there is so moch of it. And tymbre and stone haue I prepared, thou mayest get more therof.
{22:15} Thou hast many workmen also, mesons and carpenters in stone and tymber, and all maner of men that haue vnderstondinge in all worke
{22:16} off golde, syluer, brasse, and yron without nombre. Yet get the vp, and be doynge, and the LORDE shal be with the.
{22:17} And Dauid commaunded all the rulers of Israel, to helpe Salomon his sonne, and sayde:
{22:18} Is not the LORDE youre God with you, and hath geuen you rest on euery syde? for he hath delyuered the inhabiters of the londe in to youre handes, and the londe is subdued before the LORDE and before his people.
{22:19} Geue ouer youre hert now therfore and youre soule, to seke the LORDE youre God, and get you vp, and buylde a Sanctuary vnto the LORDE God, that the Arke of the couenaunt of the LORDE and the holy vessels of God, maye be brought in to the house, which shalbe buylded vnto the name of the LORDE.
{23:1} So Dauid made Salomon his sonne kynge ouer Israel, whan he himselfe was olde, and had lyued ynough.
{23:2} And Dauid gathered all the rulers in Israel together, and the prestes & Leuites,
{23:3} to nombre ye Leuites from thirtie yeare olde & aboue. And ye nombre of the (which were stroge men) fro heade to heade, was eight and thirtie thousande:
{23:4} of whom there were foure & twentie thousande, which dyd their diligence in the worke ouer ye house of the LORDE, and sixe thousande officers and Iudges,
{23:5} and foure thousande porters, & foure thousande that songe prayses vnto ye LORDE with instrumentes, which he had made to synge prayse with all.
{23:6} And Dauid made the ordinaunce amonge the children of Leui, namely amoge Gerson, Kahath & Merari.
{23:7} The Gersonites were: Laedan and Simei.
{23:8} The children of Laedan: the first, Iehiel, Sethan, and Ioel, these thre.
{23:9} The children of Simei were: Salomith, Hasiel and Haran, these thre. These were the chefe amonge the fathers of Laedan.
{23:10} These also were the children of Simei: Iahath, Sina, Ieus and Bria, these foure were Simeis children also.
{23:11} Iahath was the first, Sina the seconde. As for Ieus and Bria, they had not many childre, therfore were they couted but for one fathers house.
{23:12} The childre of Kahath were: Amram, Iezehar, Hebron and Vsiel, these foure.
{23:13} The childre of Amram were: Aaron and Moses. As for Aaron, he was separated, to be sanctified for the Most holy, he & his sonnes for euer, to burne incense before the LORDE, & to mynister and blesse in ye name of the LORDE for euermore.
{23:14} And the children of Moses the man of God were named amonge ye trybe of the Leuites.
{23:15} The childre of Moses were Gerson and Elieser.
{23:16} The children of Gerson, the fyrst was Sebuel.

{23:24} These are the children of Leui amonge their fathers houses, and the chefest of the fathers, which were counted after the nombre of ye names heade by heade: which executed the worke of the offices in the house of the LORDE from thirtie yeare olde & aboue.
{23:25} For Dauid sayde: The LORDE God of Israel hath geuen his people rest, & shall dwell at Ierusalem for euer.
{23:26} Amonge ye Leuites also were the childre of Leui nombred from thirtie yeare olde and aboue, that they neded not to beare ye Habitacion with all the vessels of their office,
{23:27} but acordinge to ye last wordes of Dauid,
{23:28} yt they shulde stonde vnder the hande of the children of Aaron, to mynister in the house of the LORDE in the courte, and to the chestes, and for purifyenge, and to all maner of sanctifyenge, and to euery worke of the office in the house of God.
{23:29} And for ye shewbred, for the fyne floure, for the meatoffrynge, for the vnleuended wafers, for the pannes, for ye fryenge, and for all maner of weight and measure.
{23:30} And in the mornynge to stonde for to geue thankes and to prayse the LORDE, and in the euenynge likewyse.

{23:32} to wayte vpon the Tabernacle of witnesse and of the Sactuary, and vpon their brethre the children of Aaron, to mynister in the house of the LORDE.
{24:1} This was ye ordinaunce of the childre of Aaron. The children of Aaron were, Nadab, Abihu, Eleasar and Ithamar.
{24:2} But Nadab and Abihu dyed before their fathers, and had no children. And Eleasar and Ithamar were prestes.
{24:3} And Dauid ordred them after his maner: Sadoc out of the children of Eleasar, and Ahimelech out of the children of Ithamar, acordinge to their nombre and office.
{24:4} And there were mo chefe stronge men founde amonge the children of Eleasar, then the children of Ithamar. And he ordeyned them after this maner: namely, sixtene out of ye childre of Eleasar to be rulers thorow out their fathers house: & eight of the children of Ithamar thorow out their fathers house.
{24:5} Neuertheles he ordeyned them by lot, because that both the pryncipall of the children of Eleasar and of Ithamar were in ye Sanctuary, and chefe before God.
{24:6} And the Scrybe Semeia the sonne of Nethaneel one of the Leuites, wrote them vp before ye kynge and before the rulers, and before Sadoc the prest, & before Ahimelech the sonne of Abiathar, & before the chefe of the fathers amonge the prestes & Leuites: namely one fathers house for Eleasar, and the other for Ithamar.

{28:7} & wyll stablishe his kyngdome for euer, yf he be constant to do after my commaundementes and lawes, as it is this daye.

{29:1} And kynge Dauid sayde vnto all the congregacion: God hath chosen Salomon one of my sonnes, which yet is yonge and tender. But the worke is greate: for it is not a mans palace, but the LORDE Gods.
{29:2} Yet haue I after all my abilite prepared vnto the house of God, golde for the vessels of golde, syluer for them of syluer, brasse for them of brasse, yron for the of yron, wod for them of wod, Onix stones, set Rubyes, & stones of dyuerse coloures, & all precious stones, & Marble stones in multitude.

{29:5} yt the same which ought to be of golde, maye be of golde: & that it which ought to be of syluer, maye be of syluer: and for all maner of worke by the hande of the craftesmen. And who is now fre wyllinge, to fyll his hande this daye vnto the LORDE?
{29:6} Then were the prynces of the fathers, ye prynces of the trybes of Israel, the captaynes ouer thousandes & ouer hundreds, the rulers ouer the kynges busynes, fre wyllinge,

{29:9} And ye people were glad that they were fre wyllinge: for they gaue it wt a good wyll (euen with all their hert) vnto the LORDE. And Dauid also ye kynge reioysed greatly,
{29:10} and praysed God, and sayde before the whole congregacion: Praysed be thou O LORDE God of Israel oure father,
{29:11} vnto the belongeth worshippe and power, glory, victory & thankes: for all that is in heauen and earth, is thine: thine is ye kyngdome, and thou art exalted aboue all prynces.
{29:12} Thine are riches and honoure before ye, thou reignest ouer all, in thy hande consisteth power and might, in thy hade is it to make euery man greate and stronge.
{29:13} Now thake we the oure God, and prayse ye name of thy glory:
{29:14} For who am I? What is my people? that we shulde be able with a fre wyll to offre, as this is done? For of the commeth all, and of thy hande haue we geuen it the:
{29:15} For we are but pilgrems & straugers before the, as were all oure fathers. Oure life vpon earth is as a shadowe, and here is no abydinge.
{29:16} O LORDE oure God, all this abundaunce that we haue prepared to buylde the an house vnto thy name, came of thy hande, and is thine alltogether.
{29:17} I knowe my God, that thou tryest the hert, and that vnfaynednes is acceptable vnto the: therfore haue I geue all this with an vnfayned hert, eue with a good wyll, and now haue I had ioye to se thy people (which here are present) offre with a fre wyll vnto the.
{29:18} O LORDE God of oure fathers Abraham, Isaac, & Israel, kepe thou euermore soch purposes and thoughtes in ye hertes of thy people, & prepare thou their hertes vnto the.
{29:19} And graunte my sonne Salomon a perfecte hert, that he maye kepe thy comaundementes, thy testimonies, & thy statutes, that he maye do all, & buylde this palace, which I haue prepared.
{29:20} And Dauid sayde vnto the whole cogregacion: O prayse the LORDE yor God. And all the cogregacion praysed ye LORDE God of their fathers, & bowed them selues, & worshipped the LORDE & then the kynge,
{29:21} and offred sacrifices vnto the LORDE. And on ye nexte morow offred they burntofferynges, a M. bullockes, a M. rames, a M. labes wt their drynkofferynges, & plenteously offred they amonge all Israel.
{29:22} And they ate and dranke the same daie before the LORDE with greate ioye, and made Salomon the sonne of Dauid kynge ye seconde tyme, and anoynted him to be ye prynce for the LORDE, & Sadoc to be the prest.
{29:23} Thus sat Salomon vpon the seate of ye LORDE, kynge in his fathers steade, & prospered. And all Israel obeyed him,
{29:24} & all ye rulers & mightie men, & all kynge Dauids children submytted themselues vnto kynge Salomon.
{29:25} And ye LORDE made Salomon excellent & greate in ye sighte of all Israel, and gaue him soch a glorious kyngdome, as none had before him ouer Israel.
{29:26} So had Dauid now bene kynge ouer all Israel.
{29:27} And ye tyme that he was kynge ouer Israel, is fortye yeares: At Hebron reigned he seuen yeare, and at Ierusalem thre & thirtie yeare,
{29:28} & dyed in a good age, full of dayes, riches and honoure. And Salomon his sonne was kynge in his steade.
{29:29} These actes of kynge Dauid (both ye first and last) beholde, they are wrytten amonge the actes of Samuel the Seer, and amonge the actes of the prophet Nathan, and amoge the actes of Gad the Seer,
{29:30} with all his kyngdome, power and tymes which passed vnder him, both vpon Israel & vpon all the kyngdomes of the earth.

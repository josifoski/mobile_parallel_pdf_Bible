{1:1} Paul an Apostle (not of men, nor by ma, but by Iesus Christ & by God the father, which raysed him vp fro ye deed)
{1:2} & all the brethre which are wt me. Vnto the cogregacios in Galacia.
{1:3} Grace be with you, and peace fro God the father, and oure LORDE Iesus Christ,
{1:4} which gaue him selfe for oure synnes, that he mighte delyuer vs from this present euel worlde, acordinge to the wyll of God oure father,
{1:5} to whom be prayse for euer and euer. Amen.
{1:6} I maruell yt ye are so soone turned (from him that called you in the grace of Christ) vnto another Gospell:
{1:7} which is nothinge els, but that there be some, which trouble you, and intende to peruerte the Gospell of Christ.
{1:8} Neuertheles though we oure selues, or an angell from heaue preach vnto you eny other Gospel, the yt which we haue preached vnto you, the same be acursed.
{1:9} As we haue sayde afore, so saye we now agayne: Yf eny ma preach vnto you eny other thinge, the yt ye haue receaued, ye same be acursed.
{1:10} Preach I men now or God? Or go I aboute to please men? Yf I shulde yet please men, I were not the seruaunt of Christ.
{1:11} But I certifye you brethren, yt the Gospell which is preached of me, is not of men.
{1:12} For I nether receaued it ner lerned it of ma, but by the reuelacion of Iesus Christ.
{1:13} For ye haue herde of my conuersacion afore tyme in the Ieweshippe, how that beyode measure I persecuted the cogregacion of God, and spoyled it,
{1:14} and preuayled in the Ieweshippe aboue many of my companyons in my nacion, & was a moch more feruent manteyner of the tradicions of the fathers.
{1:15} But whan it pleased God which separated me fro my mothers wombe, and called me by his grace,
{1:16} for to declare his sonne in me, that I shulde preach him thorow the Gospell amonge the Heythen, immediatly I commened not of the matter with flesh and bloude:
{1:17} nether came I to Ierusalem vnto them which were Apostles before me: but wente my wayes in to Arabia, and came agayne to Damascon.
{1:18} Then after thre yeare I came to Ierusale to se Peter, and abode with him fyftene dayes.
{1:19} As for the other Apostles, I sawe none of them, saue Iames the LORDES brother.
{1:20} The thinges that I wryte vnto you, beholde, God knoweth, I lye not.
{1:21} After that wente I in to the coastes of Syria and Celicia:
{1:22} but of face I was vnknowne to ye Christen congregacions in Iewrye.
{1:23} Neuertheles they had herde onely, that: He that persecuted vs in tyme passed, preacheth now ye faith which some tyme he destroyed:
{1:24} and they praysed God in me.
{2:1} Then after fourtene yeares, I wente vp agayne to Ierusale with Barnabas, and toke Titus with me also.
{2:2} But I wente vp by reuelacion, and commened with the of ye Gospell, which I preach amonge the Heythe: but specially with the which were in reputacion, lest I shulde runne or had runne in vayne.
{2:3} But Titus which was also with me, was not compelled to be circucysed, though he was a Greke:
{2:4} and that because of certayne incommers beynge false brethre, which came in amoge other, to spye out oure libertye, which we haue in Christ Iesus, that they mighte brynge vs in to bondage:
{2:5} To whom we gaue no rowme, no not for the space of an houre, as concernynge to be broughte in to subieccion: yt the trueth of the Gospell mighte comtynue with you.
{2:6} As for the that semed to be greate, what they were in tyme passed, it maketh no matter to me. For God loketh not on the outwarde appearaunce of men. Neuertheles they which semed greate, taught me nothinge:
{2:7} but contrary wyse, whan they sawe that the Gospell ouer the vncircumcision was comytted vnto me, as ye Gospell ouer ye circucision was commytted vnto Peter.
{2:8} (For he yt was mightie with Peter to the Apostleshippe ouer the circumcision, the same was mightie with me also amoge the Heythen)
{2:9} they perceaued the grace that was geuen vnto me. Iames and Cephas and Ihon, which semed to be pilers, gaue me and Barnabas ye righte handes, and agreed with vs, that we shulde preach amonge the Heythe, and they amonge the Iewes:
{2:10} onely that we shulde remebre the poore, which thinge also I was diligent to do.
{2:11} But wha Peter was come to Antioche, I withstode him in ye face: for he was worthy to be blamed.
{2:12} For afore there came certayne from Iames, he ate with the Heythe. But wha they were come, he withdrue and separated himselfe, fearinge the which were of the circumcision.
{2:13} And the other Iewes dyssembled with him likewyse, in so moch yt Barnabas was brought in to their symulacion also.
{2:14} But whan I sawe that they walked not right after ye trueth of the Gospell, I sayde vnto Peter openly before all: Yf thou beynge a Iewe, lyuest after the maner of the Gentyles, and not as do the Iewes, why causest thou the Gentyles then to lyue as do the Iewes?
{2:15} Though we be Iewes by nature, and not synners of the Gentyles,
{2:16} yet (in so moch as we knowe, that a man is not made righteous by the dedes off the lawe, but by the faith on Iesus Christ) we haue beleued also on Iesus Christ, yt we might be made righteous by the faith of Christ, and not by the dedes of the lawe, because that by the dedes of the lawe no flesh shal be iustified.
{2:17} Yf we then which seke to be made righteous by christ, shulde be yet founde synners or selues, is not Christ then the mynister of synne? God forbyd.
{2:18} For yf I buylde agayne yt which I haue destroyed, then make I my selfe a trespacer.
{2:19} But I thorow the lawe am deed vnto the lawe, that I might lyue vnto God.
{2:20} I am crucified with Christ, yet do I lyue: neuerthelesse now not I, but Christ lyueth in me. For ye life which I now lyue in ye flesshe, I lyue in the faith of ye sonne of God which loued me, and gaue himselfe for me.
{2:21} I cast not awaye the grace of God. For yf righteousnes come by the lawe, then dyed Christ in vayne.
{3:1} O ye folishe Galathias, who hath bewitched you, that ye shulde not beleue the trueth? To who Iesus Christ was descrybed before the eyes and amonge you crucified.
{3:2} This onely wolde I lerne of you: Receaued ye the sprete by the dedes of the lawe, or by the preachinge of the faith?
{3:3} Are ye so vnwyse? Ye beganne in the sprete, wolde ye ende now the in the flesh?
{3:4} Haue ye suffred so moch in vayne? Yf it be els in vayne.
{3:5} He that geueth you the sprete, and doth soch greate actes amoge you, doth he it thorow the dedes of the lawe, or by ye preachinge of the faith?
{3:6} Euen as Abraha beleued God, and it was counted vnto him for righteousnes.
{3:7} Thus ye knowe, that they which are of faith, are Abrahams children.
{3:8} The scripture sawe afore hade, that God iustifieth the Heythen thorow faith. Therfore shewed it glad tydinges afore vnto Abraham, and sayde: In the shal all the Heythen be blessed.
{3:9} So then they which be of faith, are blessed with faithfull Abraham.
{3:10} For as many as go aboute with the workes of the lawe, are vnder ye curse: For it is wrytte: Cursed be euery man, which cotynueth not in all thinges that are wrytte in the boke of the lawe, to do them.
{3:11} That no man is iustified by the lawe in the sighte of God, it is euydet: For ye iust shal lyue by his faith.
{3:12} The lawe is not of faith, but the ma that doth ye same, shal lyue therin.
{3:13} But Christ hath delyuered vs from ye curse of the lawe, whan he became a curse for vs. (For it is wrytte: Cursed is euery man that hangeth on tre)
{3:14} yt the blessynge of Abraham mighte come on the Gentyles in Christ Iesu, and yt we might so receaue ye promysed sprete, thorow faith.
{3:15} Brethren, I wil speake after the maner of men. Though it be but a mas Testamet, yet no man despyseth it, or addeth eny thinge therto, whan it is confirmed.
{3:16} To Abraham and his sede were the promyses made. He sayeth not: In the sedes, as in many, but in thy sede, as in one, which is Christ.
{3:17} This Testament (I saye) which afore was confirmed to Christ warde, is not disanulled (that the promes shulde be made of none affecte) by the lawe which was geuen beyonde foure hundreth & thirtie yeares therafter.
{3:18} For yf the enheritaunce be gotten by the lawe, then is it not geuen by promes. But God gaue it frely vnto Abraham by promes.
{3:19} Wherfore the serueth the lawe? It was added because of trangression, tyll the sede came, to the which the promes was made. And it was geuen of angels, by the hande of the mediatoure.
{3:20} A mediatour is not a mediatour of one onely, but God is one.
{3:21} Is the lawe then agaynst the promyses of God? God forbyd. Howbeit yf there had bene geuen a lawe which coulde haue geue life, the no doute righteousnes shulde come of the lawe.
{3:22} But ye scripture hath shut vp all vnder synne, that ye promes shulde come by the faith on Iesus Christ, geue vnto the that beleue.
{3:23} Before faith came, we were kepte and shut vp vnder the lawe, vnto the faith which shulde afterwarde be declared.
{3:24} Thus ye lawe was or scolemaster vnto Christ, that we might be made righteous by faith.
{3:25} But now that faith is come, we are nomore vnder the scolemaster.
{3:26} For ye all are the children of God by the faith in Christ Iesu.
{3:27} For as many of you as are baptysed, haue put on Christ.
{3:28} Here is nether Iewe ner Greke: here is nether bode ner fre: here is nether man ner woman, for ye are all one in Christ Iesu.
{3:29} Yf ye be Christes, the are ye Abrahas sede and heyres acordynge to the promes.
{4:1} But I saye: As longe as the heyre is a childe, there is no difference betwene him and a seruaunt, though he be lorde of all ye goodes:
{4:2} but he is vnder tuters and gouerners, vntyll the tyme appoynted of the father.
{4:3} Euen so we also, wha we were children, were in bondage vnder the outwarde tradicions.
{4:4} But whan the tyme was fulfylled, God sent his sonne, borne of a woma, and put vnder the lawe,
{4:5} to redeme them which were vnder the lawe, that we mighte receaue ye childshippe.
{4:6} For so moch the as ye are children, God hath sent the sprete of his sonne in to oure hertes, which cryeth: Abba, deare father.
{4:7} Wherfore now, thou art not a seruaunt, but a sonne. Yf thou be a sonne, then art thou the heyre of God thorow Christ.
{4:8} Notwithstondinge whan ye knewe not God, ye dyd seruyce vnto them, which by nature are no Goddes.
{4:9} But now seynge ye knowe God (yee rather are knowne off God) how is it that ye turne you backe agayne vnto the weake and beggerly tradicions, wher vnto ye desyre agayne afresh to be in bondage?
{4:10} Ye obserue dayes and monethes, and tymes and yeares.
{4:11} I am in feare of you, lest I haue bestowed laboure on you in vayne.
{4:12} Brethre I beseke you, be ye as I am, for I am as ye are. Ye haue not hurte me at all.
{4:13} For ye knowe how that in weaknes after ye flesh I preached ye Gospell vnto you at the first:
{4:14} and my tentacion which I suffred after the flesh, ye despysed not, nether abhorred, but receaued me as an angell of God, yee euen as Christ Iesus.
{4:15} How happy were ye then? For I beare you recorde, that yf it had bene possible, ye had plucked out youre awne eyes, and geue them vnto me.
{4:16} Am I therfore become yor enemy, because I tell you ye trueth?
{4:17} They are gelous ouer you amysse. Yee they wolde make you to fall backe, that ye might be feruet to the warde.
{4:18} It is good to be feruent, so yt it be allwaye in a good thinge, and not onely whan I am present wt you.
{4:19} My litle children (of whom I trauayle in byrth agayne, vntyll Christ be fashioned in you)
{4:20} I wolde I were wt you now, and coulde chauge my voyce, for I stode i doute of you.
{4:21} Tell me ye that wylbe vnder the lawe, haue ye not herde the lawe?
{4:22} For it is wrytten, that Abraham had two sonnes the one by a bonde mayde, the other by a fre woman.
{4:23} As for him that was of the bode mayde, he was borne after ye flesh: but he which was of the fre woman, was borne by promes.
{4:24} These wordes betoken somwhat. For these wemen are the two Testamentes: The one from the mount Sina, that gendreth vnto bondage, which is Agar.
{4:25} For Agar is called in Arabia ye mount Sina, and reacheth vnto Ierusalem which now is, and is in bondage with hir children.
{4:26} But Ierusalem that is aboue, is the fre woman, which is the mother of vs all.
{4:27} For it is wrytte: Reioyse thou baren, that bearest no childre: breake forth and crye thou yt trauaylest not, for the desolate hath many mo childre, then she which hath an hussbande.
{4:28} As for vs (brethren) we are the children of Isaac acordinge to the promes.
{4:29} But like as at that tyme, he that was borne after the flesh, persecuted him yt was borne after the sprete, euen so is it now also.
{4:30} But what sayeth the scripture? Put awaye the bonde mayden and hir sonne: for the sonne of ye bondmayde shal not be heyre with ye sonne of the fre woman.
{4:31} So now brethren, we are not children of the bonde mayde, but of the fre woman.
{5:1} Stonde fast therfore in the libertye wherwith Christ hath made vs fre, and be not wrapped agayne in the yocke off bondage.
{5:2} Beholde, I Paul saye vnto you: Yf ye be circumcysed, Christ profiteth you nothinge at all.
{5:3} I testifye agayne vnto euery man which is circumcysed, that he is bounde to kepe the whole lawe.
{5:4} Ye are gone quyte from Christ, as many off you as wylbe made righteous by the lawe, and are fallen from grace.
{5:5} But we wayte in the sprete off hope, to be made righteous by faith.
{5:6} For in Christ Iesu nether is circumcision eny thinge worth ner vncircumcision, but faith which by loue is mightie in operacion.
{5:7} Ye ranne well, who was a let vnto you, that ye shulde not obeye the trueth?
{5:8} Soch councell is not of him that hath called you.
{5:9} A litle leuen sowreth the whole lompe of dowe.
{5:10} I haue trust towarde you in ye LORDE, that ye wylbe none otherwyse mynded. But he that troubleth you, shal beare his iudgment, what so euer he be.
{5:11} Brethren yf I yet preach circumcision, why do I suffre persecucion? then had the slaunder off the crosse ceassed.
{5:12} Wolde God they were roted out fro amoge you, which trouble you.
{5:13} But brethre, ye are called vnto liberty, onely let not youre libertie be an occasion vnto the flesh, but by loue serue one another.
{5:14} For all the lawe is fulfylled in one worde, namely in this: loue thy neghboure as thy selfe.
{5:15} But yf ye byte and deuoure one another, take hede, that ye be not consumed one of another.
{5:16} I saye: Walke in the sprete, and so shal ye not fulfill the lustes off the flesshe.
{5:17} For the flesh lusteth agaynst the sprete, and the sprete agaynst the flesh. These are contrary one to the other, so that ye can not do that which ye wolde:
{5:18} But and yf ye be led of the sprete, then are ye not vnder the lawe.
{5:19} The dedes of ye flesh are manifest, which are these: Aduoutrye, whordome, vnclenes, wantanes,
{5:20} Idolatrye, witchcraft, hatred, variaunce, zele, wrath, stryfe, sedicion, sectes,
{5:21} envyenge, murthur, dronkennes, glotony, and soch like: of the which I tell you before, as I haue tolde you in tyme past, that they which commytte soch, shal not inheret the kyngdome of God.
{5:22} But the frute of the sprete, is loue, ioye, peace, longe sufferinge, getlenes, goodnesse, faithfulnes,
{5:23} mekenesse, teperaunce, Agaynst soch is not ye lawe:
{5:24} But they that are Christes, haue crucified their flesh, with the lustes and desyres.
{5:25} Yf we lyue in the sprete, let vs walke also in the sprete.
{5:26} Let vs not be vayne glorious, prouokinge one another, and envyenge another.
{6:1} Brethren, Yf eny ma be ouertaken of a faute, ye which are spirituall, enfourme him with a meke sprete: and considre thine owne selfe, that thou also be not tempted.
{6:2} Beare ye one anothers burthe, and so shal ye fulfyll the lawe of Christ.
{6:3} But yf eny man thinke himselfe to be somwhat (whan in dede he is nothinge) the same disceaueth himselfe.
{6:4} Let euery man proue his owne worke, and the shal he haue reioysinge in his awne selfe, and not in another.
{6:5} For euery one shal beare his owne burthen.
{6:6} But let him that is taughte with the worde, mynister in all good thinges, vnto him that teacheth him.
{6:7} Be not disceaued, God wil not be mocked. For what soeuer a man soweth, that shal he reape.
{6:8} He that soweth vpon the flesh, shal of the flesh reape destruccion: But he that soweth vpon ye sprete, shal of the sprete reape life euerlastinge.
{6:9} Let vs not be weery of well doynge: for wha the tyme is come, we shal reape without ceassinge.
{6:10} Whyle we haue tyme therfore, let vs do good vnto all men but specially vnto the which are of ye housholde of faith.
{6:11} Beholde, with how many wordes I haue wrytten vnto you with myne awne hande.
{6:12} They that wil please in the flesh, constrayne you to be circumcysed, onely lest they shulde be persecuted with the crosse of Christ.
{6:13} For eue they them selues which are circumcysed, kepe not the lawe, but wolde haue you circucysed, that they mighte reioyse in youre flesh.
{6:14} But God forbyd that I shulde reioyse, saue onely in the crosse of oure LORDE Iesus Christ, wherby the worlde is crucified vnto me, and I vnto the worlde.
{6:15} For in Christ Iesu nether circucision avayleth eny thinge, ner vncircumcision, but a new creature.
{6:16} And as many as walke acordynge to this rule, peace and mercy be vpon the, and vpon Israel of God.
{6:17} From hence forth let no man put me to busynesse, for I beare in my body the markes of the LORDE Iesu.
{6:18} Brethren, the grace of oure LORDE Iesu Christ be with youre sprete Amen.

{1:2} for the truthes sake which dwelleth in vs, and shalbe with vs for euer.
{1:3} Grace, mercy, and peace be with you fro the LORDE Iesus Christ ye sonne of the father in the trueth and in loue.
{1:4} I am greatly reioysed, that I haue founde amonge thy children, them that walke in ye trueth, as we haue receaued a commaundement of the father.
{1:5} And now lady I beseke the (not as though I wrote a new commaundement vnto the, but the same which we haue had from the begynnynge) that we loue one another.
{1:6} And this is the loue, that we walke after his commaundementes. This is the commaundement (as ye haue herde fro the begynnynge) that we shulde walke therin.
{1:7} For many disceauers are come in to the worlde, which confesse not yt Iesus Christ is come in the flesh: this is a disceauer and an Antechrist.
{1:8} Take hede to youre selues, that we lose not that which we haue wrought, but that we maye receaue a full rewarde.
{1:9} Whoso euer transgresseth, and abydeth not in the doctryne of Christ, hath not God: he that abydeth in ye doctryne of Christ, hath both the father and the sonne.
{1:10} Yf eny man come vnto you, and brynge not this doctryne, receaue him not in to the house, nether salute him:
{1:11} for he that saluteth him, is partaker of his euell dedes.
{1:12} I had many thinges to wryte vnto you: neuertheles I wolde not wryte wt papyre and ynke, but I trust to come vnto you, and to speake with you mouth mouth, that oure ioye maye be full.
{1:13} The children of thy electe sister salute the. Amen.

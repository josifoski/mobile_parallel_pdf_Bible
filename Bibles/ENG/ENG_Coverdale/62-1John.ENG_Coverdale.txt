{1:1} That which was from ye begynnynge, which we haue herde, which we haue sene with or eyes, which we haue loked vpon, and or handes haue handled of the worde of life:
{1:2} and the life hath appeared, and we haue sene, and beare wytnes, and shewe vnto you ye life that is euerlastinge, which was with the father, and hath apeared vnto vs.
{1:3} That which we haue sene & herde, declare we vnto you, that ye also maye haue fellishippe with vs, and that oure fellishippe maye be with the father and with his sonne Iesus Christ.
{1:4} And this wryte we vnto you, that youre ioye maye be full.
{1:5} And this is the tydinges which we haue herde of him, & declare vnto you, that God is lighte, and in him is no darknes at all.
{1:6} Yf we saye that we haue fellishippe with him, and yet walke in darknes, we lye, and do not the trueth.
{1:7} But yf we walke in lighte, euen as he is in lighte, then haue we fellishippe together, and the bloude of Iesus Christ his sonne clenseth vs from all synne.
{1:8} Yf we saye that we haue no synne, we disceaue oure selues, and the trueth is not in vs.
{1:9} But yf we knowlege oure synnes, he is faithfull and iust to forgeue vs oure synnes, & to clense vs from all vnrighteousnes.
{1:10} Yf we saye, we haue not synned, we make him a lyar, and his worde is not in vs.
{2:1} My litle children, these thinges wryte I vnto you, that ye shulde not synne: and yf eny man synne, we haue an aduocate with the father, euen Iesus Christ which is righteous:
{2:2} and he it is that optayneth grace for oure synnes: not for oure synnes onely, but also for the synnes of all the worlde.
{2:3} And hereby are we sure that we knowe him, yf we kepe his comaundemetes.
{2:4} He that sayeth: I knowe him, and kepeth not his comaundemetes, is a lyar, and the trueth is not in him,
{2:5} But who so kepeth his worde, in him is the loue of God perfecte in dede. Hereby knowe we, that we are in him.
{2:6} He yt sayeth he abydeth in him, oughte to walke euen as he walked.
{2:7} Brethren, I wryte no new commaundement vnto you, but that olde commaundement, which ye haue herde from the begynnynge.
{2:8} The olde comaundement is the worde, which ye haue herde from the begynnynge. Agayne, a new comaundemet wryte I vnto you, a thinge that is true in him & also in you: for the darknesse is past, and the true lighte now shyneth.
{2:9} He that sayeth he is in lighte, and hateth his brother, is yet in darknesse.
{2:10} He yt loueth his brother, abydeth in the lighte, and there is none occasion of euell in him.
{2:11} But he yt hateth his brother, is in darknes, and walketh in darknes, and can not tell whither he goeth, for ye darknes hath blynded his eyes.
{2:12} Babes, I wryte vnto you, that yor synnes are forgeuen you for his names sake.
{2:13} I wryte vnto you fathers, how that ye haue knowne him which is from ye begynnynge. I wryte vnto you yonge me, how that ye haue euercome the wicked. I wryte vnto you litle children, how that ye haue knowne the father.
{2:14} I haue wrytten vnto you fathers, how that ye haue knowne him, which is fro the begynnynge. I haue wrytten vnto you yonge men, how that ye are stronge, and the worde of God abydeth in you, and ye haue ouercome that wicked.
{2:15} Se that ye loue not the worlde, nether ye thinges that are in the worlde. Yf eny man loue the worlde, the loue of the father is not in him:
{2:16} for all that is in the worlde (namely the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pryde of life) is not of the father, but of the worlde.
{2:17} And the worlde passeth awaye and the lust therof. But he that fulfylleth the wyll of God, abydeth for euer.
{2:18} Litle children, it is the last houre, and (as ye haue herde that Antechrist shal come) euen now are there many become Antechristes allready: wherby we knowe, that it is ye last houre.
{2:19} They wente out fro vs, but they were not of vs: for yf they had bene of vs, they wolde no doute haue contynued with vs. But that they maye be knowne, how that they are not all of vs.
{2:20} But ye haue the anoyntinge of him yt is holy, & ye knowe all thiges.
{2:21} I haue not wrytte vnto you, as though ye knewe not ye trueth but ye knowe it, & are sure, yt no lye cometh of ye trueth.
{2:22} Who is a lyar, but he yt denyeth yt Iesus is Christ? The same is ye Antichrist, yt denyeth the father & ye sonne.
{2:23} Whosoeuer denyeth the sonne, the same hath not the father.
{2:24} Loke what ye haue herde now from ye begynnynge, let the same abyde in you. Yf yt which he herde from the begynnynge shal remayne in you, then shal ye also abyde in ye sonne and in the father.
{2:25} And this is the promes yt he hath promysed vs, eue eternall life.
{2:26} This haue I wrytte vnto you cocerninge the that disceaue you.
{2:27} And the anoyntinge which ye haue receaued of him, dwelleth in you: & ye nede not yt eny ma teach you, but as the anoyntinge teacheth you all thiges, euen so is it true, & is no lye. And as it hath taughte you, eue so abide ye therin.
{2:28} And now babes, abyde in hi, yt wha he shal appeare, we maye be bolde, & not be made ashamed of him at his commynge.
{2:29} Yf ye knowe yt he is righteous, knowe also that he which doth righteousnes, is borne of him.
{3:1} Beholde what loue the father hath shewed on vs, yt we shulde be called the childre of God. Therfore ye worlde knoweth you not, because it knoweth not him.
{3:2} Dearly beloued, we are now ye childre of God, and yet hath it not appeared what we shalbe. But we knowe yt when he shal appeare, we shal be like him: for we shal se him as he is.
{3:3} And euery man yt hath this hope in him, pourgeth him selfe, euen as he is pure.
{3:4} Who so euer comytteth synne, comytteth vnrighteousnes also, and synne is vnrighteousnes.
{3:5} And ye knowe that he appeared to take awaye oure synnes: and in him is no synne.
{3:6} Who so euer abydeth in him, synneth not: who soeuer synneth, hath not sene him nether knowne him.
{3:7} Babes, let noman disceaue you. He that doeth righteousnes, is righteous, euen as he is righteous.
{3:8} He that commytteth synne, is of the deuell: for the deuell synneth sence ye begynnynge. For this purpose appeared the sonne of God, to lowse the workes of the deuell.
{3:9} Who so euer is borne of God, synneth not: for his sede remayneth in him, & he ca not synne, because he is borne of God.
{3:10} By this are the children of God knowne & the children of the deuell. Who so euer doeth not righteousnes, is not of God, nether he thath loueth not his brother.
{3:11} For this is the tydinges which ye haue herde from the begynnynge, that ye shulde loue one another,
{3:12} not as Cain, which was of the wicked, and slewe his brother. And wherfore slewe he him? euen because his awne workes were euell, and his brothers righteous.
{3:13} Maruayle not (my brethren) though the worlde hate you.
{3:14} We knowe yt we are traslated from death vnto life, because we loue the brethren. He that loueth not his brother, abydeth in death.
{3:15} Who soeuer hateth his brother, is a mansleyer. And ye knowe that a mansleyer hath not eternall life abydinge in him.
{3:16} Hereby haue we perceaued loue, that he gaue his life for vs, and therfore ought we also to geue oure lyues for the brethre.
{3:17} But he yt hath this worldes good, & seyth his brother haue nede, and shutteth vp his hert fro him, how dwelleth the loue of God in him?
{3:18} My litle children, let vs not loue with worde nether with tonge, but with ye dede, and with the trueth.
{3:19} Hereby knowe we, that we are of the verite, and can quyete oure hertes before him.
{3:20} But yf oure hert condemne vs, God is greater the oure hert, and knoweth all thinges.
{3:21} Dearly beloued, yf oure hert condemne vs not, then haue we a fre boldnes to God warde.
{3:22} And what so euer we axe, we shal receaue it: because we kepe his comaundemetes, and do those thinges, which are pleasaunt in his sighte.
{3:23} And this is his comaundement, that we beleue on ye name of his sonne Iesus Christ, and loue one another, as he gaue commaundement.
{3:24} And he that kepeth his commaundementes, dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby knowe we that he abydeth in vs, euen by the sprete which he hath geuen vs.
{4:1} Dearly beleued, beleue not ye euery sprete, but proue the spretes, whether they be of God. For many false prophetes are gone out in to the worlde.
{4:2} Hereby shal ye knowe the sprete of God: Euery sprete which confesseth, that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God:
{4:3} And euery sprete which confesseth not that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not off God. And this is that sprete of Antechrist, off whom ye haue herde, how that he shal come, and euen now allready is he in the worlde.
{4:4} Litle children, ye are off God, and haue ouercome them: for greater is he that is in you, then he that is in the worlde.
{4:5} They are off the worlde, therfore speake they off the worlde, and the worlde herkeneth vnto them.
{4:6} We are of God, and he that knoweth God, herkeneth vnto vs: he that is not of God, heareth vs not. Here by knowe we the sprete of trueth, and ye sprete of erroure.
{4:7} Dearly beloued, let vs loue one another, for loue commeth of God. And euery one yt loueth, is borne of God, and knoweth God.
{4:8} He that loueth not, knoweth not God: for God is loue.
{4:9} By this appeared the loue of God to vs warde, because that God sent his onely begotten sonne in to this worlde, that we mighte lyue thorow him.
{4:10} Herein is loue, not that we loued God, but that he loued vs, and sent his sonne to make agremet for oure synnes.
{4:11} Dearly beloued, yf God so loued vs, we oughte also to loue one another.
{4:12} No man hath sene God at eny tyme. Yf we loue one another, God dwelleth in vs, and his loue is perfecte in vs.
{4:13} Hereby knowe we that we dwell in him, and he in vs, because he hath geuen vs of his sprete.
{4:14} And we haue sene, & testifye that the father sent the sonne to be the Sauioure of the worlde.
{4:15} Whosoeuer now confesseth yt Iesus is the sonne of God in him dwelleth God, and he in God:
{4:16} and we haue knowne and beleued the loue that God hath to vs. God is loue, and he that dwelleth in loue dwelleth in God, and God in him.
{4:17} Here in is the loue perfecte with vs, that we shulde haue a fre boldnesse in the daye of iudgment: for as he is, eue so are we in this worlde.
{4:18} Feare is not in loue, but perfecte loue casteth out feare: for feare hath paynefulnes. He that feareth, is not perfecte in loue.
{4:19} Let vs loue him, for he loued vs first.
{4:20} Yf eny man saye: I loue God, & yet hateth his brother, he is a lyar. For he that loueth not his brother whom he seyth, how can he loue God, whom he seyth not?
{4:21} And this comaundement haue we of him, that he which loueth God, shulde loue his brother also.
{5:1} Who so euer beleueth that Iesus is Christ, is borne of God. And who soeuer loueth him that begat, loueth him also which was begotten of him.
{5:2} By this we knowe that we loue Gods children, whan we loue God, and kepe his commaundementes.
{5:3} For this is the loue of God, that we kepe his commaundementes, and his commaundemetes are not greuous.
{5:4} For all that is borne of God, ouercommeth the worlde: and this is the victory that ouercommeth the worlde, eue oure faith.
{5:5} Who is it yt ouercommeth the worlde, but he which beleueth that Iesus is the sonne of God?
{5:6} This is he that cometh with water and bloude, euen Iesus Christ: not with water onely, but with water and bloude. And it is the sprete that beareth wytnes: for the sprete is the trueth.
{5:7} (For there are thre which beare recorde in heauen: the father, the worde, and the holy goost, & these thre are one.)
{5:8} And there are thre which beare recorde in earth: the sprete, water and bloude, and these thre are one.
{5:9} Yf we receaue the witnesse of men, the witnesse of God is greater: for this is the wytnesse of God, which he testifyed of his sonne.
{5:10} He that beleueth on ye sonne of God, hath the wytnes in him selfe. He that beleueth not God, hath made him a lyar.
{5:11} And this is that recorde, euen yt God hath geue vs euerlastinge life. And this life is in his sonne.
{5:12} He that hath the sonne of God, hath life: He that hath not the sonne of God, hath not life.
{5:13} These thinges haue I wrytte vnto you, which beleue on the name of the sonne of God, that ye maye knowe, how that ye haue eternall life, and that ye maye beleue on ye name of the sonne of God.
{5:14} And this is the fre boldnesse which we haue towarde him, that yf we axe eny thinge acordinge to his wyll, he heareth vs.
{5:15} And yf we knowe that he heareth vs what so euer we axe, then are we sure that we haue ye peticions, which we haue desyred of him.
{5:16} Yf eny man se his brother synne a synne not vnto death, let him axe, and he shal geue him life, for the yt synne not vnto death. There is a synne vnto death, for the which saye I not that a man shulde praye.
{5:17} All vnrighteousnes is synne, and there is synne not vnto death.
{5:18} We knowe, that whosoeuer is borne off God, synneth not: but he that is begotte of God, kepeth himselfe, & yt wicked toucheth him not.
{5:19} We knowe that we are of God, & the worlde is set alltogether on wickednes.
{5:20} But we knowe, that the sonne of God is come, and hath geuen vs a mynde, to knowe him which is true: and we are in him yt is true, in his sonne Iesu Christ. This is the true God, and euerlastinge life.
{5:21} Babes kepe youre selues from ymages. Amen.

{1:1} It chaused, in the xxx. yeare the fifth daye off the fourth Moneth, that I was amonge the presoners by the ryuer off Cobar: where the heauens opened, & I sawe a vision of God.
{1:2} Now the fifth daye off the Moneth made out the fyfth yeare off kynge Ioachims captiuyte.
{1:3} At the same tyme came ye worde off the LORDE vnto Ezechiel the sonne off Buzi prest, in the londe off the Caldees by the water of Cobar, where the honde off the LORDE came vpo him.
{1:4} And I loked: & beholde, a stormy wynde came out off the north with a greate cloude full of fyre, which wt his glistre lightened all rounde aboute. And in ye myddest off the fyre it was all cleare,
{1:5} and as it were the licknesse of foure beastes, which were fashioned like a man: sauynge,
{1:6} that euery one had foure faces and foure wynges.
{1:7} Their legges were straight, but their fete were like bullockes fete, and they glistred, as it had bene fayre scoured metall.
{1:8} Vnder their wynges vpon all the foure corners, they had mens hondes. Their faces and their wynges were towarde the foure corners:
{1:9} yet were the wynges so, that one euer touched another. When they wente, they turned them not aboute: but ech one wente straight forwarde.
{1:10} Vpon the rightside off these foure, their faces were like the face off a man and the fa off a Lyon: But vpon the leftside, they had the face off an oxe and the face off an Aegle.
{1:11} Their faces also and their wynges were spred out aboue: so that two wynges off one touched euer two wynges off another, and with the other two they couered their bodie.
{1:12} Euery one when it wente, it wente straight forwarde. Where as the sprete led them, thither they wente, and turned not aboute in their goynge.
{1:13} The fashion and countenauce of the beestes was like hote coales off fyre, euen as though burnynge cresshettes had bene amonge the beestes: and the fyre gaue a glistre, and out off the fyre there wente lighteninge.
{1:14} Whe ye beestes wete forwarde & backwarde, one wolde haue thought it had lightened.
{1:15} Now whe I had well considered the beestes, I sawe a worke off wheles vpon the earth with foure faces also like the beestes.
{1:16} The fashion & worke of the wheles was like the see. The foure wheles were ioyned and made (to loke vpon) as it had bene one whele in another.
{1:17} When one wente forwarde, they wente all foure, and turned the not aboute i their goinge.
{1:18} They were large, greate and horrible to loke vpon. Their bodies were full off eyes rounde aboute them all foure. Whe the beestes wete, the wheles wente also with them:
{1:19} And when the beestes lift them selues vp from ye earth, the wheles were lift vp also.
{1:20} Whyther so euer the sprete wente, thither wente they also, & ye wheles were lift vp & folowed the. for ye sprete of life was in the wheles.
{1:21} When ye beestes wete forth, stode still, or lift themselues vp from the earth: then the wheles also wente, stode still, & were lift vp, for ye breth off life was in the wheles.
{1:22} Aboue ouer ye heades of the beestes there was a firmament, which was fashioned as it had bene off the most pure Christall, & that was spred out aboue vpon their heades:
{1:23} vnder the same firmament were their wynges layed abrode, one towarde another, and two wynges couered the body of euery beest.
{1:24} And when thy wente forth, I herde the noyse off their wynges, like the noyse of greate waters, as it had bene the voyce off the greate God, and a russhinge together as it were off an hoost off men. And when they stode still, they let downe their
{1:25} Now when they stode still, and had letten downe their wynges, it thondred in the firmament, that was aboue their heades.
{1:26} Aboue the firmament that was ouer their heades, there was the fashion off a seate, as it had bene made off Saphir. Apon the seate there sat one like a ma.
{1:27} I behelde him, and he was like a cleare light, as it had bene all of fyre with in from his loynes vpwarde. And beneth when I loked vpon him vnder ye loynes, me thought he was like a shyninge fyre, that geueth light on euery syde. Yee the shyne and glistre yt lightened rounde aboute,
{1:28} was like a raynbowe, which in a raynie daye apeareth in the cloudes. Eue so was the similitude, wherin the glory off the LORDE apeared. Whe I sawe it, I fell vpon my face, and herkened vnto the voyce off him, that spake.
{2:1} Then sayde he vnto me: Stonde vp vpon thy fete (O thou sonne of ma) and I will talke with the.
{2:2} And as he was commonynge with me, the sprete came in to me, and set me vp vpon my fete: so that I marcked the thinge, that he sayde vnto me.
{2:3} And he sayde: Beholde, thou sonne off man: I will sende the to the children off Israel, to those runnagates and obstinate people: for they haue take parte agaynst me, and are runne awaye fro me: both they, and their forefathers, vnto this daye.
{2:4} Yee I will sende ye vnto a people yt haue rough vysages and stiff stomackes: vnto whom thou shalt saye on this maner: This the LORDE God himselff hath spoken,
{2:5} yt whether they be obedient or no (for it is a frauwarde housholde) they maye knowe yet that there hath bene a prophet amonge them.
{2:6} Therfore (thou sonne off man) feare the not, nether be afrayed off their wordes: for they shall rebell agaynst the, and despise ye. Yee thou shalt dwell amonge scorpions: but feare not their wordes, be not abashed at their lokes, for it is a frauwerde housholde.
{2:7} Se that thou speake my wordes vnto them, whether they be obediet or not, for they are obstinate.
{2:8} Therfore (thou sonne of man) obeye thou all thinges, that I saye vnto ye, and be not thou stiffnecked, like as they are a stiffnecked housholde. Open thy mouth, and eate that I geue the.
{2:9} So as I was lokynge vp, beholde, there was sent vnto me an hande, wherin was a closed boke:
{2:10} and the hande opened it before me, and it was written within and without, full off carefull mourninges: alas, and wo.
{3:1} Then sayde he vnto me: thou sonne of ma, eate that, what so euer it be: Yee eate that closed boke, and go thy waye, and speake vnto the children off Israel.
{3:2} So I opened my mouth, and he gaue me the boke for to eate,
{3:3} and sayde vnto me: Thou sonne of man, thy bely shal eate, and thy bowels shalbe fylled with ye boke, that I geue the. Then dyd I eate the boke, and it was in my mouth sweter then hony.
{3:4} And he sayde vnto me: thou sonne of ma, get the soone vnto the house off Israel, ad shewe the ye wordes, that I comaunde the:
{3:5} for I sende the not to a people that hath a strauge, vnknowne or harde speache, but vnto the house off Israel:
{3:6} Not to many nacions, which haue diuerse speaches and harde languages, whose wordes thou vnderstodest not: Neuertheles, yf I sent the to those people, they wolde folowe the:
{3:7} But the house off Israel wil not folowe ye, for they wil not folowe me: Yee all the house off Israel haue stiff foreheades and harde hertes.
{3:8} Beholde therfore, I will make thy face preuayle agaynst their faces, and harden thy foreheade agaynst their foreheades:
{3:9} so that thy foreheade shall be harder then an Adamat or flynt stone: that thou mayest feare them ye lesse, and be lesse afrayed off them, for they are a frauwerde housholde.
{3:10} He sayde morouer vnto me: thou sonne off man, take diligent hede with thine eares, to ye wordes that I speake vnto the, fasten them in thine herte:
{3:11} and go to the presoners off thy people, speake vnto them, ad saye on this maner: Thus the LORDE God hath spoke: Whether ye heare, or heare not.
{3:12} With that, the sprete toke me vp. And I herde the noyse of a greate russhinge and remouynge off the most blissed glory off the LORDE out off his place.
{3:13} I herde also the noyse off the wynges off the beestes, that russhed one agaynst another, yee and the ratlynge off the wheles, that were by them, which russhinge & noyse was very greate.
{3:14} Now when the sprete toke me vp, and caried me awaye, I wente with an heuy and a soroufull mynde, but the honde off ye LORDE comforted me right soone.
{3:15} And so in the begynnynge off the Moneth Abib, I came to the presoners, that dwelt by the water off Cobar, and remayned in that place, where they were: and so continued I amonge them seuen dayes, beinge very sory.
{3:16} And when the seuen dayes were expyred, the LORDE sayde vnto me:
{3:17} Thou sonne off man, I haue made the a watch man vnto the house of Israel: therfore take good hede to the wordes, and geue them warnynge at my commaundement.
{3:18} Yff I saye vnto the, concernynge the vngodly ma, that (without doute) he must dye, and thou geuest him not warnynge, ner speakest vnto him, that he maye turne from his euell waye, and so to lyue: Then shall the same vngodly man dye in his owne vnrightuosnes: but his bloude will I requyre off thyne honde.
{3:19} Neuertheles, yff thou geue warnynge vnto the wicked, and he yet forsake not his vngodlynesse: then shall he dye in his owne wickednesse, but thou hast discharged thy soule.
{3:20} Now yf a rightuous ma go fro his rightuousnesse, and do the thinge that is euell: I will laye a stomblinge blocke before him, and he shall dye, because thou hast not geuen him warninge: Yee dye shall he in his owne synne, so that the vertue, which he did before, shall not be thought vpon: but his bloude will I requyre of thine honde.
{3:21} Neuertheles, yf thou exhortest the rightuous, that he synne not, and so ye rightuous do not synne: Then shall he lyue, because he hath receaued thy warnynge, and thou hast discharged thy soule.
{3:22} And there came the hode off the LORDE vpon me, and he sayde vnto me: Stonde vp, and go in to the felde, yt I maye there talke with the.
{3:23} So when I had rysen vp, and gone forth into the felde: Beholde, the glory off the LORDE stode there, like as I sawe it afore, by the water off Cobar. Then fell I downe vpon my face,
{3:24} and ye sprete came in to me, which set me vp vpon my fete, and sayde thus vnto me: Go thy waye, and sparre thy selff in thyne house.
{3:25} Beholde (O thou sonne off man) there shall chaynes be brought for the, to bynde the wt all, so that thou shalt not escape out off the.
{3:26} And I will make thy tunge cleue so the rofe off thy mouth, that thou shalt be domme, and not be as a chider with them: for it is an obstinate housholde.
{3:27} But when I speake vnto the, then open thy mouth, and saye: Thus saieth the LORDE God: who so heareth, let him heare: who so will not, let him leaue: for it is a frauwarde housholde.
{4:1} Thou sonne off man: take a tyle stone, and laye it before the, and descrybe vpon it the cite off Ierusalem:
{4:2} how it is beseged, how bulworkes and stroge diches are grauen on euery syde off it: descrybe also tentes, and an hoost off men rounde aboute it.
{4:3} Morouer, take an yron panne, and set it betwixte the & ye cite in steade off an yron wall, Then set thy face towarde it, besege it, and laye ordinaunce agaynst it, to wynne it. This shal be a token vnto the house off Israel.
{4:4} But thou shalt slepe vpon thy left syde, and laye the synne of the house off Israel vpon the. Certayne dayes apoynted, thou shalt slepe vpon that syde, and beare their synnes.
{4:5} Neuertheles I will apoynte the a tyme (to put off their synnes) and the nombre off the daies: Thre hundreth & xc. dayes must thou beare the wickednesse off the house of Israel.
{4:6} When thou hast fulfilled these dayes, lye downe agayne, and slepe vpon thy right syde xl. dayes, and beare the synnes off the house of Iuda. A daye for a yeare, a daye (I saye) for a yeare, will I euer laye vpon the.
{4:7} Therfore set now thy face agaynst that beseged Ierusalem, and discouer thine arme, that thou mayest prophecie agaynst it.
{4:8} Beholde, I will laye chaynes vpon the, that thou shalt not turne the from one syde to another, till thou hast ended the dayes of thy sege.
{4:9} Wherfore, take vnto the wheate, barly beanes, growell sede, milium and fitches: and put these together in a vessell, and make the loaues of bred therof, acordinge to the nombre of the dayes that thou must lye vpon yi syde: that thou mayest haue bred to eate, for thre hundreth and XC. dayes.
{4:10} And the meate that thou eatest, shall haue a certayne waight apoynted: Namely, twentie sycles euery daye. This apoynted meate shalt thou eate daylie, from the beginnynge to the ende.
{4:11} Thon shalt dryncke also a certayne measure off water: Namely, the sixte parte of an Hin shalt thou drynke daylie from the begynnynge to the ende.
{4:12} Barly cakes shalt thou eate, yet shalt thou first strake the ouer with mas donge, yt they maye se it.
{4:13} And with that, sayde the LORDE: Euen thus shal the children of Israel eate their defyled bred in the myddest off the Gentiles, amonge whom I will scatre them.
{4:14} Then sayde I: Oh LORDE God, Beholde, my soule was yet neuer stayned: for fro my youth vp vnto this houre, I dyd neuer eate of a deed carcase, or of that which was slayne of wilde beestes, nether came there euer eny vnclene flesh in my mouth.
{4:15} Where vnto he answered me, and sayde: Well than, I will graunte the to take cowes donge, for the donge off a man, and to strake the bred ouer with all, before the.
{4:16} And he sayde vnto me: Beholde thou sonne off man, I will mynishe all the prouysion of bred in Ierusalem, so that they shall weye their bred, and eate it with scarcenesse. But as for water, they shall haue a very litle measure theroff, to drynke.
{4:17} And when they haue nomore bred ner water, one shal be destroyed with another, and famish awaye for their wickednesse.
{5:1} Take the then a sharpe knyfe (O thou sonne of man) namely, a rasoure. Take that, and shaue the hayre off thy heade and beerd: Then take the scoales and the waight, and deuyde the hayre a sunder.
{5:2} And burne the thirde parte therof in the fyre in the myddest off the cite, and cut the other thirde parte in peces with a knyfe. As for the thirde parte that remayneth, cast it in the wynde, and then shewe the bare knyfe.
{5:3} Yet afterwarde take a litle off the same, & bynde it in they cote lappe.
{5:4} Then take a curtesy of it, and cast it in the myddest of ye fyre, and burne it in the fyre. Out of the same fyre shall there go a flame, vpon the whole house of Israel.
{5:5} Morouer, thus sayde the LORDE God: This same is Ierusalem. I set her in the middest of the Heithen and nacions, that are rounde aboute her,
{5:6} but she hath despised my iudgmetes more then ye Gentiles the selues, and broken my comaundementes more then the nacions, that lye rounde aboute her: For they haue cast out myne ordinaunces, and not walked in my lawes.
{5:7} Therfore, thus saieth the LORDE God: For so moch as ye wt youre wickednesse farre exceade the Heithe, that dwell rounde aboute you: (For ye haue not walked in my lawes, nether haue ye kepte myne ordinauces)
{5:8} Therfore thus saieth ye LORDE God: I will also come vpon the, for in the myddest of the will I syt in iugdmet, in the sight of the Heithen,
{5:9} and will handle the of soch a fashion, as I neuer dyd before, and as I neuer wil do from that tyme forth, and that because of all thy abhominacions.
{5:10} For in the the fathers shal be fayne to eate their owne sonnes, and the sonnes their owne fathers. Soch a courte will I kepe in the, and the whole remnaunt will I scatre in to all the wyndes.
{5:11} Wherfore, as truly as I lyue (saieth the LORDE God) seynge thou hast defyled my Sanctuary, with all maner off abhominacions and with all thy shamefull offences: For this cause will I also destroye the. Myne eye shall not ouersee the, nether will I spare the.
{5:12} One thirde parte within the, shall die of the pestilence and of honger: Another thirde parte shall be slayne downe rounde aboute the, with the swearde: The other thirde parte that remayneth, will I scatre abrode towarde all the wyndes, and drawe out the swearde after them.
{5:13} Thus wil I perfourme my indignacion and set my wrath agaynst them, and ease my self. So that when I haue fulfilled myne anger agaynst them, they shall knowe, that I am the LORDE, which wt a feruent gelousy haue spoken it.
{5:14} Morouer I will make the waist and abhorred, before all the Heithen that dwell aboute the, and in the sight off all them, that go by the:
{5:15} so that when I punysh the in my wrath, in myne anger, and with the plage off my whote displeasure: thou shalt be a very abhominacion, shame, a gasinge and wondringe stocke, amonge the Heithen that lye aboute the. Euen I the LORDE haue spoken it, and it shall come to passe,
{5:16} when I shute amonge them the perlous dartes of hoger, which shalbe but death: Yee therfore shall I shute them, because I will destroye you. I will encrease hunger, and mynish all the prouysion off bred amonge you.
{5:17} Plages and mysery will I sende you, yee and wilde beestes also to destroye yon. Pestilence and bloudsheddinge shall come vpon you, and the swearde wil I bringe ouer you. Euen I the LORDE, haue sayde it.
{6:1} The worde of the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{6:2} Thou sonne off man, turne thy face to the mountaynes of Israel, that thou mayest prophecie vnto them,
{6:3} and saye: Heare the worde of the LORDE God, o ye mountaynes off Israel: Thus hath the LORDE God spoken to the moutaynes, hilles, valleys and dales: Beholde, I will brynge a swearde ouer you, and destroye youre hie places:
{6:4} I wil cast downe youre aulters, and breake downe youre temples. Youre slayne men will I laye before youre goddes,
{6:5} and the deed carcases off the children off Israel will I cast before their ymages, youre bones wil I strowe rounde aboute youre aulters,
{6:6} and dwellinge places. The cities shalbe desolate, ye hillchapels layed waist: youre aulters destroyed, & broken: youre goddes cast downe, and taken awaye, yor tepels layde eaue with the groude, youre owne workes clene roted out.
{6:7} Youre slayne men shall lie amonge you, that ye maye lerne to knowe, how yt I am the LORDE.
{6:8} Those yt amoge you haue escaped the swearde, will I leaue amonge the Gentiles, for I will scatre you amonge the nacions.
{6:9} And they that escape from you, shall thinke vpon me amonge the heithen, where they shalbe in captiuyte. As for that whorish and vnfaithfull herte of theirs, wherwith they runne awaye fro me, I will breake it: yee & put out those eyes off theirs, that committe fornicacion with their Idols. Then shall they be ashamed, and displeased with their selues, for the wickednesses ad abhominacions, which they haue done:
{6:10} and shal lerne to knowe, how that it is not in vayne, that I the LORDE spake, to bringe soch mysery vpon them.
{6:11} The LORDE sayde morouer vnto me: Smyte thine hondes together, and stampe with thy fete, and saye: Wo worth all the abhominacions and wickednesses of the house of Israel, for because of the, they shal perish with the swearde, with hoger and with pestilence.
{6:12} Who so is farre of, shall dye off the pestilence: he that is nye at hande, shall perish with the swearde: and ye other that are beseged, shall dye of honger. Thus wil I satisfie my wrothfull displeasure vpon them.
{6:13} And so shall ye lerne to knowe, that I am the LORDE, whe youre slayne men lye amoge youre goddes, and aboute youre aulters: vpon all hie hilles and toppes off mountaynes, amoge all grene trees, amonge all thicke okes: euen in the places, where they dyd sacrifice to all their Idols.
{6:14} I will stretch myne honde out vpon them, & will make the londe waist: So that it shall lye desolate and voyde, from the wildernesse off Deblat forth, thorow all their habitacions: to lerne them for to knowe, that I am the LORDE.
{7:1} The worde off the LORDE came vnto me, on this maner:
{7:2} The I call, O thou sonne off man. Thus saieth the LORDE God vnto the londe off Israel: The ende commeth, yee verely the ende commeth vpon all the foure corners off the earth.
{7:3} But now shall the ende come vpon the: for I will sende my wrath vpo the, and wil punysh the: acordinge to thy wayes, and rewarde the after all thy abhominacios.
{7:4} Myne eye shall not ouersee the, nether will I spare the: but rewarde the, acordinge to thy waies, and declare thy abhominacions. Then shall ye knowe, that I am the LORDE.
{7:5} Thus saieth the LORDE God: Beholde, one mysery and plage shall come after another:
{7:6} the ende is here. The ende (I saye) that waiteth for the, is come already,
{7:7} ye houre is come agaynst the, that dwellest in the londe. The tyme is at honde, the daye of sedicio is hard by, & no glad tidinges vpo the moutaynes.
{7:8} Therfore, I will shortly poure out my sore displeasure ouer the, and fulfill my wrath vpon the. I will iudge the after thy waies, and recompence the all thy abhominacions.
{7:9} Myne eye shal not ouersee the, nether wil I spare the: but rewarde the after thy waies, and shewe thy abhominacions: to lerne you for to knowe, how yt I am the LORDE, yt smyteth.
{7:10} Beholde, the daye is here, the daye is come, the houre is runne out, the rodde florisheth, wylfulnesse waxeth grene,
{7:11} malicious violece is growne vp, and the vngodly waxen to a staff. Yet shall there no complaynte be made for them, ner for the trouble that shall come of these thinges.
{7:12} The tyme cometh, the daye draweth nye: Who so byeth, let him not reioyce: he that selleth, let him not be sory: for why, Trouble shall come in the myddest off all rest:
{7:13} so that the seller shall not come agayne to the byer, for nether off them both shall lyue. For the vision shal come so greatly ouer all, yt it shal not be hyndered: No ma also wt his wickednesse shall be able to saue his owne life.
{7:14} The trompettes shall ye blowe, and make you all ready, but no man shall go to the batell, for I am wroth with all the whole multitude.
{7:15} The swearde shalbe without, pestilence and honger within: so that who so is in the felde, shalbe slayne with the swearde: and he that is in the cite, shall perish with honger and pestilence.
{7:16} And soch as escape and fle from amonge them, shal be vpon the hilles, like as the doues in the felde: euery one shalbe afrayed, because off his owne wickednesse.
{7:17} All hondes shalbe letten downe, and all knees shalbe weake as the water:
{7:18} they shall gyrde them selues with sack cloth, feare shal fall vpon them. Their faces shall be confouded, and their heades balde:
{7:19} their syluer shall lye in the stretes, and their golde shalbe despised: Yee their syluer and golde maye not delyuer them, in the daye of the fearfull wrath of the LORDE. They shall not satisfie their hongrie soules, nether fyll their emptie belies therwith: For it is become their owne decaye thorow their wickednesse:
{7:20} because they made therof, not only costly Ieweles for their pompe and pryde, but also abhominable ymages and Idols. For this cause will I make them to be abhorred.
{7:21} Morouer, I will geue it in to ye hondes off the straungers to be spoyled: and to ye wicked, for to be robbed, and they shall destroye it.
{7:22} My face wil I turne from the, my Treasury shall be defyled: for the theues shall go into it, and suspende it.
{7:23} I wil make clene ryddaunse, for the londe is whole defyled with vnrightuous iudgment of innocent bloude, & the cite is full off abhominacions.
{7:24} Wherfore, I will bringe the most cruell tyrauntes from amonge the Heithen, to take their houses in possession. I will make the pompe off the proude to ceasse, ad they shal take in their Sanctuary.
{7:25} When this trouble cometh, they shal seke peace, but they shal haue none.
{7:26} One myschefe and sorowe shal folowe another, and one rumoure shal come after another: Then shall they seke visions in vayne at their prophetes. The lawe shal be gone from the prestes, and wysdome from the elders.
{7:27} The kynge shall mourne, the princes shalbe clothed with heuynesse, and ye hodes off the people in the londe shall tremble for feare. I will do vnto them after their owne waies, & acordinge to their owne iudgmentes will I iudge them: to lerne them for to knowe, that I am the LORDE.
{8:1} It happened, that in the sixte yeare, the fifth daye of the sixte Moneth I sat in my house, and the LORDES off the councell off Iuda with me: and the honde off the LORDE God fell euen there vpo me.
{8:2} And as I loked vp, I sawe as it were a licknesse off fyre from his loynes downwarde, and from his loynes vpwarde it shyned maruelous cleare.
{8:3} This symilitude stretched out an honde, and toke me by the hayrie lockes off my heade, and the sprete lift me vp betwixte heauen and earth: and God brought me in a vision to Ierusalem, in to the courte off the inwarde porte that lieth towarde the north: there stode an ymage, with whom he that hath all thinges in his power, was very wroth.
{8:4} And beholde, the glory off the God off Israel was in the same place: eue as I had sene it afore in the felde.
{8:5} And he sayde vnto me: Thou sonne off man, O lift vp thine eyes, and loke towarde the north. Then lift I vp myne eyes towarde the north, and beholde: Besyde the porte northwarde, there was an aulter made vnto the ymage off prouocacion in the very entrynge in.
{8:6} And he sayde furthermore vnto me: Thou sonne off man, Seist thou what these do? Seist thou the greate abhominacions that the house off Israel commytte in this place? which ought not to be done in my sanctuary? But turne the aboute, and thou shalt se yet greater abhominacions.
{8:7} And with that brought he me to the courte gate: and whe I loked, beholde, there was an hole in the wall.
{8:8} Then sayde he vnto me: Thou sonne off man, dygge thorow the wall. And when I dygged thorow the wall, beholde, there was a dore.
{8:9} And he sayde vnto me: go thy waye in, & loke what wicked abhominacions they do there.
{8:10} So I wente in, and sawe: and beholde, there were all maner ymages off wormes & beastes, all Idols and abhominacions of ye house off Israel paynted euerychone rounde aboute the wall.
{8:11} There stode also before the ymages lxx. lordes of the councell off the house off Israel: and in the myddest off them stode Iaasanias the sonne off Saphan: And euery one off them had a censoure in his honde, & out off the incense, there wente a smoke, as it had bene a cloude.
{8:12} Then sayde he vnto me: Thou sonne off man, hast thou sene what the Senatours off the house off Israel do secretly, euery one in his chambre? For they saye: Tush, the LORDE seth vs not, the LORDE regardeth not the worlde.
{8:13} And he sayde vnto me: Turne the yet agayne, and thou shat se the greate abhominacions that they do.
{8:14} And with that, he brought me to the dore off the porte off the LORDES house, towarde the north. And beholde, there sat women mournynge for Thamus.
{8:15} Then sayde he vnto me: hast thou sene this, thou sonne of ma? Turne ye aboute, & thou shalt se yet greater abhominacions.
{8:16} And so he brought me in to the inwarde courte of the LORDES house: & beholde, at the porte of the LORDES house, betwixte the fore entrie and the aulter, there were fyue and twenty men, that turned their backes vpon the Temple of the LORDE, & their faces towarde the easte, and these worshipped the Sonne.
{8:17} And he sayde vnto me: hast thou sene this, thou sonne of man? Thinketh the house of Israel, that it is but a trifle, to do these abhominacions here? Shulde they fyll the londe full of wickednesse, and vndertake to prouoke me vnto anger? Yee & purposly to cast vp their noses vpon me?
{8:18} Therfore wil I also do some thinge in my wrothfull displeasure, so that myne eye shall not ouersee them, nether wil I spare them. Yee and though they crie in myne eares with loude voyce, yet wil I not heare them.
{9:1} He cried also with a loude voyce in myne eares, sayenge: Come here ye rulers of the cite, euery man with his weapened honde to the slaughter.
{9:2} Then came there sixe men out of the strete of the vpper porte towarde the north, and euery man a weapen in his honde to the slaughter. There was one amongst them, that had on him a lynninge rayment, and a wryters ynckhorne by his syde. These wente in, and stode beside the brasen aulter:
{9:3} for the glory of the LORDE was gone awaye from the Cherub, and was come downe to the thresholde of the house, & he called the ma, that had the lynnynge rayment vpon him, and the writers ynckhorne by his syde,
{9:4} and the LORDE sayde vnto him: Go thy waye thorow the cite of Ierusalem, and set this marck [Hebrew: t] Thau vpo the foreheades of them, that mourne, and are sory for all the abhominacions, that be done therin.
{9:5} And to the other, he sayde that I might heare: Go ye after him thorow the cite, slaye, ouersee none, spare none:
{9:6} Kyll, & destroye both olde men and yonge, maydens, children, and wyues. But as for those, that haue this marck [Hebrew: t] Thau vpo them: se that ye touch them not, and begynne at my Sanctuary. Then they begane at the elders, which were in the Temple,
{9:7} for he had sayde vnto them: When ye haue defyled the Temple, and fylled the courte with the slayne, then go youre waye forth. So they wete out and slewe downe thorow ye cite.
{9:8} Now when they had done ye slaughter, & I yet escaped: I fell downe vpon my face, & cried, sayenge: O LORDE, wilt thou then destroye all the resydue of Israel, in thy sore displeasure, that thou hast poured vpo Ierusalem?
{9:9} Then sayde he vnto me: The wickednesse of the house of Israel and Iuda is very greate: so that the lode is full of bloude, and ye cite full of vnfaithfulnesse: For they saye: Tush, ye LORDE regardeth not the earth, he seyth vs not.
{9:10} Therfore will I vpon them, myne eye shall not ouersee them, nether will I spare them, but will recompence their wickednesse vpon their heades.
{9:11} And beholde, the ma that had the lynnynge rayment vpon him, and the writers, ynckhorne by his syde: tolde all the matter how it happened, and sayde: LORDE, as thou hast commaunded me, so haue I done.
{10:1} And as I loked, beholde, In the firmament that was aboue the Cherubins there apeared the similitude of a stole of Saphir vpo them:
{10:2} Then sayde he that sat therin, to him that had the lynnynge rayment vpon him: Crepe in betwene the wheles that are vnder the Cherubins, and take thine honde full of hote coales out from betwene the Cherubins, and cast them ouer the cite. And he crepte in, that I might se.
{10:3} Now the Cherubins stode vpo the right syde of the house, when the man wete in, and the cloude fylled the ynnermer courte.
{10:4} But the glory of the LORDE remoued from the Cherubins, and came vpon the thresholde of the house: so that the Temple was full of cloudes, and the courte was full of the shyne of the LORDES glory.
{10:5} Yee and the sounde of the Cherubins wynges was herde in to the forecourte, like as it had bene the voyce of the almightie God, when he speaketh.
{10:6} Now when he had bydden the man yt was clothed in lynnynge, to go and take the hote coales from the myddest of ye wheles, which were vnder the Cherubins: he wente and stode besyde the wheles.
{10:7} Then the one Cherub reached forth this honde from vnder the Cherubins, vnto ye fyre that was betwene the Cherubins, and toke therof, and gaue it vnto him (that had on the lynnynge rayment) in his honde: which toke it, and wente out.
{10:8} And vnder the wynges of ye Cherubins, there apeared the licknes of a mas hode:
{10:9} I sawe also foure wheles besyde the Cherubins, so that by euery Cherub there stode a whele. And the wheles were (to loke vpon) after ye fashion of ye precious stone of Tharsis:
{10:10} Yet (vnto the sight) were they fashioned & like, as yf one whele had bene in another.
{10:11} When they wente forth, they wete all iiij together, not turnynge aboute in their goinge: But where the first wente, thither wente they after also, so that they turned not aboute in their goinge.
{10:12} Their whole bodies, their backes, their hodes & wynges, yee & the wheles also, were all full of eyes rounde aboute them all foure.
{10:13} And I herde him call ye wheles, Galgal (that is) a rounde boull.
{10:14} Euery one of them had foure faces: so that the one face was the face of a Cherub, the seconde of a man, the thirde of a lyon, the fourth of an Aegle,
{10:15} & they were lifted vp aboue. This is the beest, that I sawe at the water of Cobar.
{10:16} Now when the Cherubins wente, the wheles wente with them: & when the Cherubins shoke their wynges to lift them selues vpwarde, the wheles remayned not behynde, but were with them also.
{10:17} Shortly, when they stode, these stode also: And when they were lift vp, ye wheles were lift vp also with the, for the sprete of life was in the wheles.
{10:18} Then the glory of the LORDE was lift vp from the thresholde of the temple, and remayned vpon the Cherubins:
{10:19} And the Cherubins flackred with their wynges, and lift the selues vp from the earth: so that I sawe when they went, and the wheles with them. And they stode at the east syde of the porte that is in the house of the LORDE. So the glory of the LORDE was vpon them.
{10:20} This is the beest that I sawe vnder the God of Israel, by the water of Cobar. And I perceaued, that it was the Cherubins.
{10:21} Euery one had foure faces, & euery one foure wynges, & vnder their winges, as it were mes hondes.
{10:22} Now the figure of their faces was, euen as I had sene them, by the water of Cobar, & so was the countenaunce of the: Euery one in his goinge wente straight forwarde.
{11:1} Morouer, the sprete of the LORDE lift me vp, & brought me vnto ye east porte of the LORDES house. And beholde, there were xxv men vnder the dore: amoge whom I sawe Iaasanias the sonne of Asur, & Pheltias the sonne of Banias, the rulers of the people.
{11:2} Then sayde the LORDE vnto me: Thou sonne of man: These men ymagin myschefe, and a wicked councel take they in this cite,
{11:3} sayenge: Tush, there is no destruccion at honde, let vs buylde houses: This Ierusalem is the cauldron, & we be the flesh.
{11:4} Therfore shalt thou prophecie vnto them, yee prophecie shalt thou vnto them, O sonne of man.
{11:5} And with that, fell the sprete of the LORDE vpon me, and sayde vnto me: Speake, thus saieth the LORDE: On this maner haue yee spoke (O ye house of Israel) and I knowe the ymaginacios of youre hertes.
{11:6} Many one haue ye murthured in this cite, & filled the stretes full of the slayne.
{11:7} Therfore, thus saieth the LORDE God: The slayne men that ye haue layed on the grounde in this cite, are the flesh, & this cite is the cauldron: But I wil bringe you out of it:
{11:8} ye haue drawe out ye swearde, eue so wil I also bringe a swearde ouer you, saieth ye LORDE God.
{11:9} I will dryue you out of this cite and delyuer you in to youre enemies honde, & wil condemne you.
{11:10} Ye shal be slayne in all the coastes of Israel, I wil be avenged of you: to lerne you for to knowe, that I am the LORDE.
{11:11} This cite shal not be youre cauldron, nether shal ye be the flesh therin: but in the coastes of Israel wil I punysh you,
{11:12} that ye maye knowe, that I am the LORDE: in whose commaundementes ye haue not walked, ner kepte his lawes: but haue done after the customes of the Heithen, that lie rounde aboute you.
{11:13} Now when I preached, Pheltias the sonne of Banias dyed. Then fell I downe vpo my face, & cried with a loude voyce: O LORDE God, wilt thou then vterly destroye all the remnaunt in Israel?
{11:14} And so the worde of the LORDE came to me on this maner:
{11:15} Thou sonne of man: Thy brethren, thy kynsfolke, & ye whole house of Iuda, which dwell at Ierusalem, saye: They be gone farre from the LORDE, but the londe is geuen vs in possession.
{11:16} Therfore tell them, thus saieth the LORDE God: I wil sende you farre of amoge the Gentiles, & scatre you amonge the nacions, & I wil halowe you but a litle, in the londes where ye shall come.
{11:17} Tell them also, thus saieth the LORDE God: I wil gather you agayne out of the nacions, & bringe you from the countrees where ye be scatred, & will geue you the londe of Israel agayne:
{11:18} & thither shal ye come. And as for all impedimentes, & all youre abhominacions: I will take them awaye.
{11:19} And I wil geue you one herte, & wil plante a new sprete within yor bowels. That stony herte wil I take out of youre body, & geue you a fleshy herte:
{11:20} that ye maye walke in my commaundementes, and kepe myne ordinaunces, & do them: that ye maye be my people, and I youre God.
{11:21} But loke whose hertes are disposed to folowe their abhominacions and wicked lyuynges: Those mens dedes will I bringe vpon their owne heades, saieth the LORDE God.
{11:22} After this dyd the Cherubins lift vp their winges, and the wheles wente with them, and the glory of the LORDE was vpon them.
{11:23} So the glory of the LORDE wente vp from the myddest of the cite, & stode vpon the mount of the cite towarde the east.
{11:24} sprete of God) it brought me agayne in to Caldea amonge the presoners. Then the vision that I had sene, vanyshed awaye fro me.
{11:25} So I spake vnto the presoners, all the wordes of the LORDE, which he had shewed me.
{12:1} The worde of the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{12:2} Thou sonne of ma, thou dwellest in the myddest of a frauwerde housholde: which haue eyes to se, & yet se not: eares haue they to heare, and yet heare they not, for they are an obstinate housholde.
{12:3} Therfore (O thou sonne of man) make thy gere redy to flit, and go forth by fayre daye light, yt they maye se. Yee eue in their sight shalt thou go from thy place to another place: yf peraduenture they wil considre, yt they be an vnobedient housholde.
{12:4} Thy gere that thou hast made redy to flit withall, shalt thou beare out by fayre daye light, that they maie se: & thou yi self shalt go forth also at eue in their sight, as a ma doth whe he flitteth.
{12:5} Dygge thorow the wall, that they maye se, and beare thorow it the same thinge, that thou tokest vp
{12:6} in their sight. As for thy self, thou shalt go forth in the darcke. Hyde thy face that thou se not ye earth, for I haue made the a shewtoke vnto the house of Israel.
{12:7} Now as ye LORDE comaunded me, so I dyd: ye gere that I had made redy, brought I out by daye. At euen I brake downe an hole thorow the wall with my honde: & when it was darcke, I toke the gere vpo my shulders, and bare them out in their sight.
{12:8} And in the mornynge, came the worde of the LORDE vnto me, sayenge:
{12:9} Thou sonne of man, yf Israel, yt frauwerde housholde axe the, and saye: what dost thou there?
{12:10} Then tell them: Thus saieth the LORDE God: This punyshment toucheth the chefe rulers at Ierusalem, and all the house of Israel, that dwell amonge them:
{12:11} Tell them: I am youre shewtoken: like as I haue done, so shal it happen vnto you: Flyt shal ye also, and go in to captiuyte.
{12:12} The chefest that is amonge you, shall lade his shulders in the darcke, and get him awaye. He shal breake downe the wall, to carie stuff there thorow: He shal couer his face, that he se not the grounde, with his eyes.
{12:13} My lyne will I sprede out vpon him, and catch him in my net, and carie him to Babilon, in the lode of the Caldees: which he shal not se, & yet shal he dye there.
{12:14} As for all his helpers, and all his hoostes that be aboute him: I will scatre them towarde all the wyndes, and drawe out a swearde after them.
{12:15} So when I haue scatred them amonge the Heithen, and strowed them in the londes: they shal knowe, that I am ye LORDE.
{12:16} But, I will leaue a litle nombre of them, from the swearde, hunger & pestilence: to tell all their abhominacions amonge the Heithen, where they come: that they maye knowe, how that I am the LORDE.
{12:17} Morouer, the worde of the LORDE came vnto me sayenge:
{12:18} Thou sonne of man: with a fearfull treblinge shalt thou eate thy bred, with carefulnesse & sorowe shalt thou drynke thy water.
{12:19} And vnto the people of the londe, speake thou on this maner: Thus saieth the LORDE God, to them that dwell in Ierusalem, and to the londe of Israel: Ye shall eate youre bred with sorowe, and drynke youre water with heuynesse: Yee the londe with the fulnesse therof shalbe layde waist, for ye wickednesse of them that dwell therin.
{12:20} And the cities that now be well occupied, shal be voyde, and the londe desolate: that ye maye knowe, how that I am the LORDE.
{12:21} Yet came the worde of the LORDE vnto me agayne, sayenge:
{12:22} Thou sonne of man, what maner of byworde is that, which ye vse in the londe of Israel, sayenge: Tush, seynge that the daies are so slacke in commynge, all the visios are of none effecte:
{12:23} Tell them therfore, thus saieth the LORDE God: I wil make that byworde to ceasse, so that it shall nomore be comonly vsed in Israel. But saye this vnto them: The daies are at honde, that euery thinge which hath bene prophecied, shalbe fulfilled.
{12:24} There shall no vision be in vayne, nether eny prophecie fayle amonge the children of Israel:
{12:25} For it is I the LORDE, that speake it: and what so euer I ye LORDE speake, it shal be perfourmed, and not be slacke in commynge. Yee euen in youre dayes (O ye frauwarde housholde) will I deuyse somethinge, & bringe it to passe, saieth the LORDE God.
{12:26} And the worde of the LORDE came vnto me sayenge:
{12:27} Beholde, thou sonne of man: The house of Israel saye in this maner: Tush, as for the vision that he hath sene, it will be many a daye or it come to passe: Is it farre of yet, the thinge that he prophecieth.
{12:28} Therfore saye vnto them: Thus saieth the LORDE God: All my wordes shal nomore be slacke: Loke what I speake, that same shal come to passe, saieth the LORDE.
{13:1} The worde of the LORDE came vnto me, sayege:
{13:2} Thou sonne of man, Speake prophecie agaynst those prophetes, that preach in Israel: & saye thou vnto them that prophecie out of their owne hertes: Heare the worde of the LORDE,
{13:3} thus saieth the LORDE God: Wo be vnto those folish prophetes, that folowe their owne sprete, and speake, where they se nothinge.
{13:4} O Israel, thy prophetes are like the foxes vpon the drie felde:
{13:5} For they stonde not in the gappes, nether make they an hedge for the house of Israel, that me might abyde the parell in the daye of the LORDE.
{13:6} Vayne thinges they se, & tell lies, to mayntene their preachinges withall. The LORDE (saye they) hath spoke it, when in very dede the LORDE hath not sent them.
{13:7} Vayne visios haue ye sene, & spoke false prophecies. when ye saye: the LORDE hath spoken it, where as I neuer sayde it.
{13:8} Therfore, thus saieth the LORDE God: Because youre wordes be vayne, & ye seke out lies: Beholde, I wil vpon you, saieth ye LORDE.
{13:9} Myne hondes shal come vpon the prophetes, that loke out vayne thinges, and preach lies: they shal not be in the councell of my people, ner written in the boke of the house of Israel, nether shal they come in the londe of Israel: that ye maye knowe, how that I am the LORDE God.
{13:10} And that for this cause: they haue disceaued my people, & tolde them of peace, where no peace was. One setteth vp a wall, & they dawbe it with lowse claye.
{13:11} Therfore tell them which dawbe it with vntempered morter, that it shall fall. For there shal come a greate shuwer of rayne, greate stones shall fall vpon it, & a sore storme of wynde shal breake it,
{13:12} so shal ye wall come downe. Shal it not then be sayde vnto you: where is now the morter, that ye dawbed it withall?
{13:13} Therfore thus saieth the LORDE God: I will breake out in my wrothfull displeasure with a stormy wynde, so that in myne anger there shal come a mightie shuwer of rayne, & hale stones in my wrath, to destroye withall.
{13:14} As for ye wall, that ye haue dawbed with vntempered morter, I wil breake it downe, & make it eauen with the grounde: so that the foundacion therof shal remoue, & it shal fall, yee & ye youre selues shall perish in the myddest therof: to lerne you for to knowe, that I am the LORDE.
{13:15} Thus wil I perfourme my wrath vpon this wall, & vpon them that haue dawbed it with vntempered morter, and then will I saye vnto you: The wall is gone, & the dawbers are awaye.
{13:16} These are the prophetes of Israel, which prophecie vnto the cite of Ierusalem, & loke out visions of peace for them, where as no peace is, saieth the LORDE God.
{13:17} Wherfore (o thou sonne of ma,) set thy face agaynst the doughters of yi people, which prophecie out of their owne hertes: & speake thou prophecie agaynst them,
{13:18} & saye: Thus saieth the LORDE God: Wo be vnto you, that sowe pilowes vnder all arme holes, and bolsters vnder the heades both of yonge and olde, to catch soules withall. For when ye haue gotten the soules of my people in youre captiuyte, ye promyse them life,
{13:19} and dishonoure me to my people, for an handfull of barly, & for a pece of bred: when ye kyll the soules of them that dye not, & promyse life to them, that lyue not: Thus ye dyssemble with my people, yt beleueth yor lies.
{13:20} Wherfore thus saieth the LORDE God: Beholde, I wil also vpo the pillowes, wherwith ye catch the soules in flyenge: the will I take from youre armes, & let the soules go, that ye catch in flyenge.
{13:21} Youre bolsters also wil I teare in peces, & delyuer my people out of youre honde: so that they shal come no more in youre hodes to be spoyled, & ye shal knowe, that I am the LORDE.
{13:22} Seinge yt with youre lyes ye discomforte the herte of the rightuous, whom I haue not discomforted: Agayne: For so moch as ye corage the honde of the wicked, so that he maye not turne from his wicked waye, & lyue:
{13:23} therfore shall ye spie out nomore vanyte, ner prophecie youre owne gessinges: for I wil delyuer my people out of youre honde, that ye maye knowe, how that I am the LORDE.
{14:1} There resorted vnto me certayne of ye elders of Israel, & sat downe by me.
{14:2} Then came the worde of the LORDE vnto me, sayenge:
{14:3} Thou sonne of man, these men beare their Idols in their hertes, & go purposly vpon the stomblinge block of their owne wickednesse: how darre they then axe councell at me?
{14:4} Therfore speake vnto them, & saye: thus saieth the LORDE God: Euery man of the house of Israel that beareth his Idols in his herte, purposynge to stomble in his owne wickednesse, and commeth to a prophet, to enquere eny thinge at me by him: vnto that man wil I the LORDE myself geue answere, acordinge to the multitude of his Idols:
{14:5} that the house of Israel maye be snared in their owne hertes, because they be clene gone fro me, for their Idols sakes.
{14:6} Wherfore, tell the house of Israel: thus saieth the LORDE God: Be conuerted, forsake youre Idols, and turne youre faces from all yor abhominacions.
{14:7} For euery man (whether he be of the house of Israel, or a straunger, that sogeourneth in Israel) which departeth fro me, and carieth Idols in his herte, purposinge to go still stomblinge in his owne wickednesse, and commeth to a prophet, for to axe councell at me thorow him: vnto yt man wil I the LORDE geue answere, by myne owne self.
{14:8} I wil set my face agaynst that man, and wil make him to be an example for other, yee and a comon byworde: and wil rote him out of my people, that he maye knowe, how yt I am the LORDE.
{14:9} And yf that prophet be disceaued, when he telleth him a worde: then I the LORDE myself haue disceaued that prophet, and wil stretch forth myne honde vpon him, to rote him out of my people of Israel:
{14:10} and they both shall be punyshed for their wickednesse. Acordinge to ye synne of him that axeth, shal the synne of the prophet be:
{14:11} that ye house of Israel be led nomore fro me thorow erroure, and be nomore defyled in their wickednesse: but that they maye be my people, and I their God, saieth the LORDE God.
{14:12} And the worde of the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{14:13} Thou sonne of man, when the londe synneth agaynst me, and goeth forth in wickednesse: I will stretch out myne hode vpon it, and destroye all the prouysion of their bred, and sende derth vpon them, to destroye man & beest in the londe.
{14:14} And though Noe, Daniel and Iob these thre men were amonge them, yet shal they in their rightuousnesse delyuer but their owne soules, saieth the LORDE God.
{14:15} Yf I bringe noysome beestes in to the londe, to waist it vp, and it be so desolate, that no man maye go therin for beestes:
{14:16} yf these thre men also were in the londe, as truly as I lyue (saieth the LORDE God) they shal saue nether sonnes ner doughters, but be only delyuered them selues: and as for the londe, it shal be waist.
{14:17} Or, yf I bringe a swearde in to the londe, and charge it to go thorow the londe: so that I slaye downe man and beest in it,
{14:18} and yf these thre men were therin: As truly as I lyue (saieth the LORDE God) they shal delyuer nether sonnes ner doughters, but only be saued them selues.
{14:19} Yf I sende a pestilence in to the londe, and poure out my sore indignacion vpon it in bloude, so that I rote out of it both man and beest,
{14:20} and yf Noe, Daniel and Iob were therin: As truly as I lyue (saieth the LORDE God) they shal delyuer nether sonnes ner doughters, but saue their owne soules in their rightuousnesse.
{14:21} Morouer, thus saieth the LORDE God: Though I sende my foure trublous plages vpon Ierusalem: the swearde, honger, perlous beestes and pestilence, to destroye man and beest out of it:
{14:22} yet shal there a remnaunt be saued therin, which shal bringe forth their sonnes and doughters. Beholde, they shal come forth vnto you, and ye shall se their waye, and what they take in honde, & ye shalbe coforted, as touchinge all the plages that I haue brought vpon Ierusalem.
{14:23} They shall comforte you, when ye se their waye and workes: and ye shal knowe, how yt it is not without a cause, that I haue done so agaynst Ierusalem, as I dyd, saieth the LORDE God.
{15:1} The worde of the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{15:2} Thou sonne of man: What commeth of the vyne amonge all other trees? and of the wyne stocke, amoge all other tymbre of the groaue?
{15:3} Do me take wodd of it, to make eny worke withall? Or maye there a nale be made of it, to hange eny thinge vpon?
{15:4} Beholde, it is cast in the fyre to be brent, the fyre consumeth both the endes of it, the myddest is brent to asshes. Is it mete then for eny worke? No.
{15:5} Seinge then, that it was mete for no worke, beinge whole: moch lesse maye there eny thinge be made of it, when the fyre hath consumed and brent it.
{15:6} And therfore thus saieth the LORDE God: Like as I cast the vyne in to the fyre for to be brent, as other trees of the wod: Euen so wil I do with them that dwell in Ierusalem,
{15:7} and set my face agaynst them: they shall go out from the fyre, and yet the fyre shall consume them. Then shal ye knowe, that I am the LORDE, when I set my face agaynst them,
{15:8} and make the londe waist: because they haue so sore offended, saieth the LORDE God.
{16:1} Agayne, the worde of LORDE spake vnto me, sayenge:
{16:2} Thou sonne of man, shewe the cite of Ierusalem their abhominacions,
{16:3} and saye: thus saieth the LORDE God vnto Ierusalem: Thy progeny and kynred came out of the londe of Canaan, thy father was an Amorite, thy mother a Cethite.
{16:4} In ye daye of thy byrth when thou wast borne, ye stringe of thy nauel was not cut of: thou wast not bathed in water to make the clene: Thou wast nether rubbed wt salt, ner swedled in cloutes:
{16:5} No man regarded the so moch, as to do eny of these thinges for ye, or to shewe the soch fauoure, but thou wast vtterly cast out vpon ye felde, yee despised wast thou in the daye of thy byrth.
{16:6} Then came I by the, and sawe the troden downe in thine owne bloude, & sayde vnto the: thou shalt be pourged from thine owne bloude, fro thine owne bloude (I saye) shalt thou be clensed.
{16:7} So I planted the, as the blossome of thy felde: thou art growen vp, & waxe greate: thou hast gotten a maruelous pleasaunt beutie, thy brestes are come vp, thy hayre is goodly growen, where as thou wast naked and bare afore.
{16:8} Now when I wente by ye, & loked vpon the: beholde, thy tyme was come, yee eue the tyme to wowe the. Then spred I my clothes ouer the, to couer thy dishonestie: Yee I made an ooth vnto the, & maried my self with the (saieth the LORDE God) & so thou becamest myne owne.
{16:9} Then wasshed I the with water, & pourged thy bloude from the. I anoynted the with oyle,
{16:10} I gaue the chaunge of raymentes, I made the shues of Taxus lether: I gyrthed ye aboute wt white sylcke, I clothed the with kerchues,
{16:11} I decked the wt costly apparell, I put rynges vpon thy fyngers: a chayne aboute thy necke,
{16:12} spages vpo thy foreheade, eare rynges vpon thyne eares, & set a beutifull crowne vpon thine heade.
{16:13} Thus wast thou deckte with syluer & golde, & thy rayment was of fyne white sylke, of nedle worke & of dyuerse colours. Thou didest eate nothinge but symnels, honny & oyle: maruelous goodly wast thou & beutifull, yee euen a very Quene wast thou:
{16:14} In so moch, that thy beuty was spoken of amonge the Heithen, for thou wast excellet in my beuty, which I put vpo the, saieth the LORDE God.
{16:15} But thou hast put confidece in thine owne beuty, & played the harlot, when thou haddest gotten the a name. Thou hast committed whordome, with all that wente by the, & hast fulfilled their desyres:
{16:16} Yee thou hast taken thy garmetes of dyuerse colours, & deckte thine aulters therwith, where vpon thou mightest fulfill thine whordome, of soch a fashion, as neuer was done, ner shalbe.
{16:17} The goodly ornametes & Iewels which I gaue the of myne owne golde and syluer, hast thou take, & made the mes ymages therof, and committed whordome withall.
{16:18} Thy garmentes of dyuerse colours hast thou taken, and deckte them therwith: myne oyle & incense hast thou set before them.
{16:19} My meate which I gaue the, as symnels, oyle & hony: (to fede the withall) that hast thou set before them, for a swete sauoure. And this came also to passe, saieth the LORDE God:
{16:20} Thou hast take thine owne sonnes & doughters, whom thou haddest begotten vnto me: and these hast thou offred vp vnto them, to be their meate. Is this but a small whordome of thine (thinkest thou)
{16:21} that thou slayest my children, and geuest them ouer, to be bret vnto them?
{16:22} And yet in all thy abhominacions and whordome, thou hast not remembred the dayes of thy youth, how naked and bare thou wast at that tyme, & troden downe in thine owne bloude.
{16:23} After all these thy wickednesses (wo wo vnto the, saieth ye LORDE)
{16:24} thou hast buylded thy stewes and brodel houses in euery place: yee at the heade of euery strete
{16:25} hast thou buylded the an aulter. Thou hast made thy beuty to be abhorred: thou hast layed out thy legges to euery one that came by, and multiplied thine whordome.
{16:26} Thou hast committed fornicacion with the Egipcians thy neghbours, which had moch flesh: & thus hast thou vsed thine whordome, to anger me.
{16:27} Beholde, I will stretch out myne honde ouer the, and wil mynish thy stoare of fode, and delyuer the ouer in to the willes of the Philistynes thine enemies, which are ashamed of thy abhominable waye.
{16:28} Thou hast played the whore also with the Assirians, which might not satisfie the: Yee thou hast played the harlot, & not had ynough.
{16:29} Thus hast thou still comitted thy fornicacion from the londe of Canaan vnto the Caldees, and yet thy lust not satisfied.
{16:30} How shulde I circumcide thine herte (saieth the LORDE God) seinge thou doest all these thinges, thou precious whore:
{16:31} buyldinge thy stewes at the heade of euery strete, and thy brodel houses in all places? Thou hast not bene as an other whore, yt maketh booste of hir wynnynge:
{16:32} but as a wife yt breaketh wedlocke, & taketh other in steade of hir husbode.
{16:33} Giftes are geuen to all other whores, but thou geuest rewardes vnto all thy louers: & offrest them giftes, to come vnto the out of all places, & to committe fornicacio with the.
{16:34} It is come to passe with the in thy whordomes, contrary to the vse of other women: yee there hath no soch fornicacion bene committed after the, seinge that thou profrest giftes vnto other, & no rewarde is geuen the: this is a contrary thinge.
{16:35} Therfore heare the worde of the LORDE, o thou harlot:
{16:36} Thus saieth the LORDE God: For so moch as thou hast spet thy moneye, & discouered thy shame, thorow thy whordome with all thy louers, and with all the Idols of thy abhominacions in the bloude of thy children, whom thou hast geuen them:
{16:37} Beholde therfore, I wil gather together all thy louers, vnto whom thou hast made thy self comon: yee & all them whom thou fauourest, and euery one that thou hatest: and will discouer thy shame before the, that they all maye se thy fylthines
{16:38} Morouer, I wil iudge the as a breaker of wedlocke and a murthurer, and recompence the thine owne bloude in wrath and gelousy.
{16:39} I wil geue the ouer in to their power, that shal breake downe thy stewes, and destroye thy brodel houses: they shal stripe the out of thy clothes, all thy fayre & beutifull Iewels shal they take from the, and so let the syt naked & bare:
{16:40} Yee they shal bringe the comon people vpon the, which shal stone the, & slaye the downe with their sweardes.
{16:41} They shall burne vp thy houses, and punysh the in the sight of many wome. Thus wil I make thy whordome to ceasse, so that thou shalt geue out no mo rewardes.
{16:42} Shulde I make my wrath to be still, take my gelousy from the, be content, and nomore to be displeased?
{16:43} seinge thou remembrest not the dayes of thy youth, but hast prouoked me to wrath in all these thinges? Beholde therfore, I wil bringe thine owne wayes vpon thine heade, saieth the LORDE God: how be it, I neuer dyd vnto the, acordinge to thy wickednesse and all thy abhominacions.
{16:44} Beholde, all they yt vse comon prouerbes, shall vse this prouerbe also agaynst the: Soch a mother, soch a doughter.
{16:45} Thou art euen thy mothers owne doughter, that hath cast of hir housbonde and hir children: Yee thou art the sister of thy sisters, which forsoke their husbodes and their children. Youre mother is a Cethite, and youre father an Amorite.
{16:46} Thine eldest sister is Samaria, she and hir doughters that dwel vpo thy left honde. But thy yongest sister that dwelleth on ye right hode, is Sodoma and hir doughters.
{16:47} Yet hast thou not walked after their wayes, ner done after their abhominacions: But in all thy wayes thou hast bene more corrupte then they.
{16:48} As truly as I lyue, saieth the LORDE God: Sodoma thy sister with hir doughters, hath not done so euel, as thou and thy doughters.
{16:49} Beholde, the synnes of thy sister Sodoma were these: Pryde, fulnesse of meate, abundaunce and Idilnesse: these thinges had she and hir doughters. Besydes that, they reached not their honde to the poore and nedy,
{16:50} but were proude, and dyd abhominable thinges before me: therfore I toke them awaye, when I had sene it.
{16:51} Nether hath Samaria done half of thy synnes, yee thou hast exceaded them in wickednesse: In so moch that in comparison of all the abhominacions which thou hast done, thou hast made thy sisters good women.
{16:52} Therfore beare thine owne shame, thou that in synne hast ouercome thy sisters: seinge thou hast done so abhominably, that they were better then thou. Be ashamed therfore (I saye) and beare thine owne confucion, thou that makest thy sisters good women.
{16:53} As for their captiuyte, namely the captiuyte of Sodoma and hir dougters: the captiuyte of Samaria and hir doughters: I wil bringe them agayne, so will I also bringe agayne thy captiuyte amoge them:
{16:54} that thou mayest take thine owne confucion vpon the, and be ashamed of all that thou hast done, and to comforte them.
{16:55} Thus thy sisters (namely) Sodoma and hir doughters: Samaria and hir doughters with yi self & thy doughters, shalbe brought agayne to youre olde estate.
{16:56} Whe thou wast in thy pryde,
{16:57} and before thy wickednesse came to light: thou woldest not heare speake of thy sister Sodoma, vntill the tyme that the Sirians with all their townes, and the Philistynes with all that lye rounde aboute them, brought the to shame and confucion:
{16:58} that thou mightest beare thine owne fylthynes and abhominacion, saieth the LORDE.
{16:59} For thus saieth the LORDE God: I shulde (by right) deale with the, as thou hast done. Thou hast despysed the ooth, and broken the couenaunte.
{16:60} Neuertheles, I wil remembre the couenaunt, that I made with the in thy youth, in so moch that it shall be an euerlastinge couenaunt:
{16:61} So that thou also remembre thy wayes, and be ashamed of the: then shalt thon receaue of me thy elder and yonger sisters, whom I wil make thy doughters, and that besyde thy couenaunt.
{16:62} And so I wil renue my couenaunt with the, yt thou mayest knowe, that I am the LORDE:
{16:63} that thou mayest thincke vpo it, be ashamed, and excuse thine owne confucion nomore: when I haue forgeuen the, all that thou hast done, saieth the LORDE God.
{17:1} The worde of the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{17:2} Thou sonne of man: put forth a darcke speakynge and a parable, vnto the house of Israel,
{17:3} and saye: Thus saieth the LORDE God: There came a greate Aegle with greate wynges, yee wt mightie longe wynges, and full of fethers of dyuerse colours, vpon the mount of Libanus, and toke a braunch from a Cedre tre,
{17:4} and brake of the toppe of his twygge, and caried it in to the londe of Canaan, and set it in a cite of marchauntes.
{17:5} He toke also a braunch of the londe, and planted it in a frutefull grounde, he brought it vnto greate waters, & set it as a willye tre therby.
{17:6} Then dyd it growe, and was a greate wyne stocke, but lowe by the grounde: thus there came of it a vyne, and it brought forth blossomes, & spred out braunches.
{17:7} But there was another Aegle, a greate one, which had greate wynges and many fethers: and beholde, ye rotes of this vyne had an huger after him, and spred out his braunches towarde him, to water his frutes:
{17:8} Neuertheles it was plated vpon a good grounde besyde greate waters: so that (by reason) it shulde haue brought out braunches and frute, and haue bene a goodly vyne.
{17:9} Speake thou therfore, thus saieth the LORDE God: Shal this vyne prospere? shal not his rotes be pluckte out, his frute broken of, his grene braunches wythereed and fade awaye? yee without ether stronge arme or many people, shal it be plucked vp by the rotes.
{17:10} Beholde, it was planted: shall it prospere therfore? Shall it not be dryed vp and withered, yee euen in the shutinge out of his blossomes, as soone as ye east wynde bloweth?
{17:11} Morouer, the worde of the LORDE came vnto me sayenge:
{17:12} Speake to that frauwarde housholde: knowe ye not, what these thinges do signifie? Tell them: Beholde, the kinge of Babilon came to Ierusalem, and toke the kinge & his prynces, and ledde them to Babilon.
{17:13} He toke of the kinges sede, and made a couenaunt with him, and toke an ooth of him: The prynces of the londe toke he with him also,
{17:14} that the londe might be holden in subieccion, and not to rebelle, but kepe the couenaunt, and fulfill it.
{17:15} But he fell from him, & sent his Embassitours in to Egipte, that he might haue horses & moch people. Shulde that prospere? Shulde he be kepte safe, that doth soch thinges? Or shulde he escape, that breaketh his couenaunt?
{17:16} As truly as I lyue, saieth the LORDE God: He shal dye at Babilon, in ye place where the kinge dwelleth, that made him kinge: whose ooth he hath despised, and whose couenaunt he hat broken.
{17:17} Nether shall Pharao with his greate hoost and multitude of people, maynteyne him in the warre: when they cast vp diches, and set vp bulworkes to destroye moch people.
{17:18} For seinge he hath despysed the ooth, and broken the couenaunt (where as he yet gaue his honde thervpon) and done all these thinges, he shall not escape.
{17:19} Therfore thus saieth the LORDE God: As truly as I lyue, I will bringe myne ooth that he hath despysed, and my couenaunt that he hath broken, vpon his owne heade.
{17:20} I wil cast my net aboute him, and catch him in my yarne. To Babilon will I cary him, there will I punysh him, because of the greate offence that he made me.
{17:21} As for those yt fle from him out of ye hoost, they shalbe slayne with the swearde. The residue shalbe scatred towarde all the wyndes: and ye shal knowe, that I the LORDE haue spoken it.
{17:22} Thus saieth the LORDE God: I will also take a braunch from an hie Cedre tre, and will set it, and take the vppermost twygge, that yet is but tendre, and plante it vpon an hie hill:
{17:23} Namely, vpon the hie hill of Sion will I plante it: that it maye bringe forth twygges, and geue frute, and be a greate Cedre tre: so that all maner of foules maye byde in it, and make their nestes vnder the shadowe of his braunches.
{17:24} And all the trees of the felde shall knowe, that I the LORDE haue brought downe the hie tre, and set the lowe tre vp: that I haue dryed vp the grene tre, and made the drye tre to florish: Euen I the LORDE yt spake it, haue also brought it to passe.
{18:1} The worde of the LORDE came vnto me, on this maner:
{18:2} what meane ye by this comon prouerbe, that ye vse in the londe of Israel, sayenge: The fathers haue eaten soure grapes, and the childres teth are set on edge?
{18:3} As truly as I lyue, saieth ye LORDE God, ye shal vse this byworde nomore in Israel.
{18:4} Beholde, all soules are myne. Like as the father is myne, so is ye sonne myne also. The soule that synneth, shal dye.
{18:5} Yf a man be godly, and do the thinge that is equall & right,
{18:6} (he eateth not vpon the hilles: he lifteth not his eyes vp to the Idols of Israel: he defyleth not his neghbours wife: he medleth wt no menstruous woman:
{18:7} he greueth no body: he geueth his detter his pledge agayne: he taketh none other mans good by violece: he parteth his mete with the hongrie: he clotheth the naked:
{18:8} he lendeth nothinge vpon vsury: he taketh nothinge ouer: he withdraweth his honde from doinge wronge: he hadleth faithfully betwixte man & man:
{18:9} he walbeth in my commaundementes, & kepeth my lawes, & perfourmeth the faithfully:) This is a rightuous ma, he shal surely lyue, saieth the LORDE God.
{18:10} Yf he now get a sonne, that is a murthurer, a shedder of bloude: yf he do one of these thinges
{18:11} (though he do not all) he eateth vpon the hilles: he defyleth his neghbours wife:
{18:12} he greueth the poore and nedy: he robbeth and spoyleth: he geueth not the detter his pledge agayne: he lifteth vp his eyes vnto Idols, & medleth with abhominable thinges:
{18:13} he lendeth vpon vsury, and taketh more ouer. Shal this man lyue? He shal not lyne. Seinge he hath done all these abhominacions, he shall dye: his bloude shalbe vpon him.
{18:14} Now yf this man get a sonne also, that seith all this fathers synnes, which he hath done: and feareth, nether doth soch like:
{18:15} Namely, he eateth not vpon the mountaynes: he lifteth not his eyes vp to the Idols of Israel: he defyleth not his neghbours wife:
{18:16} he vexeth no man: he kepeth no mans pledge: he nether spoyleth, ner robbeth eny man: he dealeth his meate with the hungrie: he clotheth the naked:
{18:17} he oppresseth not the poore: he receaueth no vsury, ner eny thinge ouer: he kepeth my lawes, and walketh in my commaundementes: This man shal not dye in his fathers synne, but shall lyue without fayle.
{18:18} As for his father: because he oppressed and spoyled his brother, and dyd wyckedly amonge his people: lo, he is deed in his owne synne.
{18:19} And yet saye ye: Wherfore the shulde not this sonne beare his fathers synne? Therfore: because the sonne hath done equyte and right, hath kepte all my commaundementes, and done them: therfore, shall he lyue in dede.
{18:20} The same soule yt synneth, shall dye. The sonne shal not beare the fathers offence, nenether shal the father beare the sonnes offence. The rightuousnes of the rightuous shall be vpon himself, and the wickednes of the wicked shal be vpon him self also.
{18:21} But yf ye vngodly will turne awaye, from all his synnes that he hath done, and kepe all my commaundemetes, and do the thinge ye is equall & right: doutles he shal lyue, and not dye.
{18:22} As for all his synnes that he dyd before, they shall not be thought vpon: but in his rightuousnes that he hath done, he shall lyue.
{18:23} For haue I eny pleasure in the death of a synner, saieth the LORDE God? but rather that he conuerte, and lyue?
{18:24} Agayne: yf the rightuous turne awaye from his rightuousnes, and do iniquyte, acordinge to all the abhominacions, that ye wicked ma doth: shal he lyue? All the rightuousnes that he hath done, shall not be thought vpo: but in the fawte that he hath offended withall, and in the synne that he hath done, he shal dye.
{18:25} And yet ye saye: Tush, the waye of ye LORDE is not indifferet. Heare therfore ye house of Israel: Is not my waye right? Or, are not youre wayes rather wicked?
{18:26} When a rightuous ma turneth awaye from his rightuousnesse, and medleth with vngodlynes: he must dye therin: Yee for the vnrightuousnes that he hath done, must he dye.
{18:27} Agayne: when the wicked man turneth awaye from his wickednesse, that he hath done, and doth the thinge which is equall and right: he shal saue his soule alyue.
{18:28} For in so moch as he remembreth himself, and turneth him from all the vngodlynes, that he hath vsed, he shall lyue, and not dye.
{18:29} And yet saieth the house of Israel: Tush, the waye of the LORDE is not equall. Are my wayes vnright, o ye house of Israel? Are not youre wayes rather vnequall?
{18:30} As for me, I wil iudge euery man, acordinge to his wayes, O ye house of Israel, saieth the LORDE God. Wherfore, be conuerted, and turne you clene from all youre wickednesse, so shal there no synne do you harme.
{18:31} Cast awaye fro you all youre vngodlynesse, that ye haue done: make you new hertes and a new sprete. Wherfore wil ye dye, O ye house of Israel?
{18:32} seynge I haue no pleasure in ye death of him that dyeth, saieth the LORDE God. Turne you then, and ye shal lyue.
{19:1} Bvt mourne thou for the prynces off Israel,
{19:2} & saye: Wherfore laye thy mother that lyonesse, amoge the lyons? & norished hir yonge ones amoge the lyons whelpes?
{19:3} to spoyle, and to deuoure folke.
{19:4} The Heithen herde of him, & toke him in their nettes, & brought him in chaynes vnto the londe of Egipte.
{19:5} Now when the damme sawe, that all hir hope & comforth was awaye, she toke another of hir whelpes, and made a lyon of him:
{19:6} which wente amonge the lyons, & became a fearce lyon: lerned to spoyle and to deuoure folcke:
{19:7} he destroyed their palaces, and made their cities waist: In so moch that the whole londe and euery thinge therin, were vtterly desolate, thorow the very voyce of his roaringe.
{19:8} Then came the Heithen together on euery syde out of all countrees agaynst him, layed their nettes for him, and toke him in their pytte.
{19:9} So they bounde him with chaynes, and brought him to the kinge of Babilon: which put him in preson, that his voyce shulde nomore be herde vpon the mountaynes of Israel.
{19:10} As for thy mother, she is like a vyne in thy bloude, planted by the watersyde: hir frutes and braunches are growen out of many waters:
{19:11} hir stalkes were so stronge, that men might haue made staues therof for officers: she grew so hie in hir stalkes. So when men sawe that she exceaded ye heith and multitude of hir braunches,
{19:12} she was roted out in displeasure, and cast downe to the grounde. The East wynde dryed vp hir frute, hir stronge stalkes were broken of, wythered and brent in the fyre.
{19:13} But now she is planted in the wildernesse, in a drye and thurstie grounde.
{19:14} And there is a fyre gone out of hir stalkes, which hath bret vp hir braunches and hir frute: so that she hath no mo stronge stalkes, to be staues for officers. This is a piteous and miserable thinge.
{20:1} In in the xvij yeare the x daye of the v Moneth, it happened, that certayne of the elders of Israel came vnto me for to axe councell at the LORDE, and sat them downe by me.
{20:2} Then came the worde of the LORDE vnto me on this maner:
{20:3} Thou sonne of man: Speake to the elders of Israel, and saye vnto them: Thus saieth the LORDE God: Are ye come hither to axe eny thinge at me? As truly as I lyue (saieth the LORDE,)
{20:4} I will geue you no answere. Wilt thou not reproue them (thou sonne of man) wilt thou not reproue them? Shewe them the abhominacions of their forefathers,
{20:5} & tell the: Thus saieth the LORDE God: In the daye when I chose Israel, and lift vp myne honde vpon the sede of the house of Iacob, & shewed my self vnto them in the londe of Egipte: Yee when I lifte vp myne honde ouer the, and sayde: I am the LORDE youre God,
{20:6} euen in the daye that I lift vp myne honde ouer them, to bringe them out of the londe of Egipte: in to a londe that I had prouyded for them, which floweth with mylcke and hony, and is a pleasaunt lode amonge all other:
{20:7} Then sayde I vnto them: Cast awaye euery man the abhominacions that he hath before him, and defyle not youre selues with the Idols of Egipte, for I am the LORDE youre God.
{20:8} But they rebelled agaynst me, and wolde not folowe me: to cast awaye euery man the abhominacions of his eyes, and to forsake the Idols of Egipte. Then I made me to poure my indignacion ouer them, and to satisfie my wrath vpon them: yee euen in the myddest of the londe of Egipte.
{20:9} But I wolde not do it, for my names sake: that it shulde not be vnhalowed before the Heithen, amonge whom they dwelt, and amonge whom I shewed my self vnto them, that I wolde bringe them out of the londe of Egipte.
{20:10} Now when I had caried them out of the londe of Egipte, and brought them into the wildernesse:
{20:11} I gaue them my commaundementes, & shewed the my lawes: which who so kepeth shal lyue in them.
{20:12} I gaue them also my holy dayes, to be a token betwixte me and them, and therby to knowe, that I am the LORDE, which haloweth them.
{20:13} And yet the house of Israel rebelled agaynst me in the wildernesse, they wolde not walke in my commaundementes, they haue cast awaye my lawes: (which whoso kepeth shulde lyue in them,) and my Sabbath daies haue thy greatly vnhalowed. The I made me to poure out my indignacion vpon them, & to cosume them in the wildernesse.
{20:14} Yet I wolde not do it, for my names sake: lest it shulde be dishonoured before the Heithe, from the which I had caried them awaye.
{20:15} But I swore vnto them in the wildernesse, that I wolde not bringe them into the londe, which I gaue them: a londe that floweth with mylcke & hony, & is a pleasure of all londes:
{20:16} & yt because they refused my lawes, & walked not in my comaundemetes, but had vnhalowed my Sabbathes, for their herte was gone after their Idols.
{20:17} Neuertheles myne eye spared the, so yt I wolde not vtterly slaye the, & cosume the in the wildernes.
{20:18} Morouer, I sayde vnto their sonnes in ye wildernesse: walke not in the statutes of yor forefathers, kepe not their ordinaunces, and defyle not youre selues with their Idols,
{20:19} for I am the LORDE youre God. But walke in my statutes, kepe my lawes & do them,
{20:20} halowe my Sabbathes: for they are a token betwixte me & you, that ye maye knowe, how yt I am the LORDE.
{20:21} Notwithstodinge, their sonnes rebelled against me also: they walked not in my statutes, they kepte not my lawes to fulfill them (which he that doth shal lyue in them) nether halowed they my Sabbath dayes. The I made me agayne to poure out my indignacion ouer them, and to satisfie my wrath vpon them in the wildernesse.
{20:22} Neuertheles I with drewe my honde for my names sake, lest it shulde be vnhalowed amonge the Heithe, before whom I had brought them forth.
{20:23} I lift vp myne honde ouer them also in the wildernesse, that I wolde scatre them amonge the Heithen, and strowe them amonge the nacions:
{20:24} because they had not kepte my lawes, but cast asyde my commaundementes, vnhalowed my Sabbathes, and lift vp their eyes to their fathers Idols.
{20:25} Wherfore I gaue them also commaundementes not good, & lawes thorow the which they shulde not lyue,
{20:26} & I vnhalowed them in their owne giftes: (when I appoynted for my self all their first borne) to make them desolate: that they might knowe, how that I am the LORDE.
{20:27} Therfore (O thou sonne of man) tell the house of Israel, thus saieth the LORDE God: Besyde all this, youre forefathers haue yet blasphemed me more, and greatly offended agaynst me:
{20:28} For after I had brought them in to the londe, yt I promysed to geue them, when they sawe euery hie hill & all the thicke trees: they made there their offringes, and prouoked me with their oblacions, makinge swete sauoures there, & poured out their drinkeofferinges.
{20:29} Then I axed them: what haue ye to do with all, that ye go thither? And therfore is it called the hie place vnto this daye.
{20:30} Wherfore, speake vnto the house of Israel: Thus saieth the LORDE God: Ye are euen as vnclene as youre forefathers, & committe whordome also with their abhominacios.
{20:31} In all youre Idols, where vnto ye bringe youre oblacios, & to whose honoure ye burne youre children: ye defyle youre selues, euen vnto this daye: how darre ye the come, and axe eny question at me? O ye housholde of Israel? As truly as I lyue (saieth the LORDE God) ye get no answere of me:
{20:32} & as for the thinge that ye go aboute, it shal not come to passe, where as ye saye: we wil be as the Heithen, & do as other people in the londe, wod & stone wil we worshipe.
{20:33} As truly as I lyue (saieth the LORDE God) I myself, wil rule you with a mightie honde, with a stretchedout arme, and with indignacion poured out ouer you:
{20:34} & wil bringe you out of the nacions and londes, wherin ye are scatred: and gather you together with a mightie hode, with a stretchedout arme & wt indignacion poured out vpon you:
{20:35} & wil bringe you in to the wildernesse of the people, & there I will reason with you face to face.
{20:36} Like as I punished yor forefathers in the wildernesse, so wil I punish you also, saieth the LORDE God.
{20:37} I wil bringe you vnder my iurisdiction, and vnder the bonde of the couenaunt.
{20:38} The forsakers also and the transgressours wil I take from amonge you, & bringe them out of the londe of youre habitacion: as for the londe of Israel, they shall not come in it: that they maye knowe, how that I am the LORDE.
{20:39} Go now then (saieth the LORDE God) ye house of Israel, cast awaye, and destroye euery man his Idols: then shal ye heare me, and nomore blaspheme my holy name with youre offrynges and Idols.
{20:40} But vpon my holy hill, eue vpon the hie hill of Israel shal all the house of Israel and all that is in the londe, worshipe me: and in the same place will I fauoure them, and there will I requyre youre heaueoffringes, and the firstlinges of youre oblacions, with all youre holy thinges.
{20:41} I wil accepte youre swete sauoure, when I bringe you from the nacions, and gather you together out of the londes, wherin ye be scatred: that I maye be halowed in you before the Heithen,
{20:42} and that ye maye knowe, that I am the LORDE, which haue brought you in to the londe of Israel: yee in to the same lode, that I swore to geue vnto youre forefathers.
{20:43} There shal ye call to remembraunce youre owne wayes and all youre ymaginacions, wherin ye baue bene defyled: and ye shal be displeased with youre owne selues, for all youre wickednes, that ye haue done.
{20:44} And ye shal knowe, that I am the LORDE: when I entreate you after my name, not after yor wicked wayes, ner acordinge to youre corrupte workes: o ye house of Israel, saieth the LORDE.
{20:45} Morouer, the worde of ye LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{20:46} Thou sonne of ma, set thy face towarde the south, & speake to the south wynde,
{20:47} and saye to the wodde towarde the souht: Heare the worde of the LORDE, thus saieth the LORDE God: Beholde, I wil kyndle a fyre in the, yt shal cosume the grene trees wt the drye. No man shal be able to quench his flame, but all that loketh from the south to the north, shal be brent therin:
{20:48} & all flesh shal se, that I the LORDE haue kyndled it, so that no man maye quench it.
{20:49} Then sayde I: O LORDE, they wil saye of me: Tush, they are but fables, that he telleth.
{21:1} The worde of the LORDE came to me, sayenge:
{21:2} Thou sonne of man, set thy face towarde Ierusalem, speake agaynst the Sanctuary, & prophecie agaynst the londe of Israel, saye to the lode of Israel:
{21:3} Thus saieth the LORDE God: Beholde, I wil vpon the, & wil drawe my swearde out of ye sheth, & rote out of ye both the rightuous & the wicked.
{21:4} Seinge then that I will rote out of the both the rightuous & wicked, therfore shal my swearde go out of his sheth, agaynst all flesh from the north to the south:
{21:5} that all flesh maye knowe, how that I the LORDE haue drawen my swearde out of the sheth, & it shal not be put in agayne.
{21:6} Mourne therfore (o thou sonne of man) yt thy loynes crack withall, yee mourne bytterly for them:
{21:7} And yf they saye, wherfore mournest thou? Then tell them: for the tydinges that commeth, at the which all hertes shall melt, all hondes shal be letten downe, all stomackes shal faynte, and all knees shall waxe feble. Beholde, it commeth & shal be fulfilled, saieth the LORDE God.
{21:8} Agayne, the worde of the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{21:9} Thou sonne of man, prophecie, and speake: Thus saieth the LORDE God: speake, the swearde is sharpened & wel scoured.
{21:10} Sharpened is it for the slaughter, & scoured yt it maye be bright. O, the destroyenge staff of my sonne, shal bringe downe all wodde.
{21:11} He hath put his swearde to ye dightinge, yt good holde maye be take of it. This swearde is sharpened & dight, yt it maye be geuen in to the honde of the manslayer.
{21:12} Crie (o thou sonne of man) and howle, for this swearde shal smyte my people, & all the rulers in Israel, which with my people shall be slayne downe to the grounde thorow this swearde.
{21:13} Smyte thou vpo thy thee, for, wherfore shulde not the plage & staff of iudgmet come?
{21:14} Prophecy thou sonne of man, & smyte thine hodes together: make the swearde two edged, yee make it thre edged, yt manslayers swearde, that swearde of the greate slaughter, which shal smyte them, euen in their preuy chambres:
{21:15} to make them abasshed & faynte at the hertes, & in all gates to make some of them fall. O how bright and sharpe is it, how wel dight & mete for ye slaughter?
{21:16} Get the to some place alone, ether vpon the right honde or on the lefte, whither so euer thy face turneth.
{21:17} I wil smyte my hondes together also, and satisfie my wrothfull indignacion: Euen I the LORDE haue sayde it.
{21:18} The worde of the LORDE came yet vnto me agayne, sayenge:
{21:19} Thou sonne of man, make the two stretes, that the swearde of ye kinge of Babilo maye come. Both these stretes shall go out of one londe. He shal set him vp a place, at the heade of the strete shal he chose him out a corner.
{21:20} Make ye a strete, that the swearde maye come towarde Rabath of the Ammonites, and to the stronge cite of Ierusalem.
{21:21} For the kinge of Babilon shall stonde in the turnynge of the waye, at the heade of the two stretes: to axe councell at the soythsayers, castinge the lottes with his arowes, to axe councell at the Idols, and to loke in the lyuer.
{21:22} But the soythsayenge shall poynte to the right syde vpon Ierusalem, that he maye set men of warre, to smyte it with a greate noyse, to crie out Alarum, to set batellrammes agaynst the gates, to graue vp dyches, & to make bulworkes.
{21:23} Neuertheles, as for ye soythsayenge, they shall holde it but for vanite, euen as though a iest were tolde them: Yee and they them selues remembre their wickednesse, so that by right they must be take and wonne.
{21:24} Therfore saieth the LORDE God: For so moch as ye youre selues shewe your offence, and haue opened youre wickednesse, so that in all youre workes men maye se youre synnes: Yee in so moch (I saye) that ye youre selues haue made mencion therof, ye shalbe taken by violence.
{21:25} O thou shameful wicked gyde of Israel, whose daye is come: euen the tyme that wickednesse shall haue an ende:
{21:26} Thus saieth the LORDE God: take awaye the mytre, and put of the crowne, and so is it awaye: the humble is exalted, and the proude brought lowe.
{21:27} Punysh, punysh, yee punysh them will I, and destroye them: and that shall not be fulfilled, vntill he come, to whom the iudgment belongeth, and to whom I haue geue it.
{21:28} And thou (o sonne of man) prophecy, & speake: Thus saieth the LORDE God to the children of Ammon, & to their blasphemy, speake thou: The swearde, the swearde, is drawen forth alredy to the slaughter, & scoured that it glistreth
{21:29} (because thou hast loked the out vanities, & prophecied lyes) yt it maye come vpon thy necke, like as vpo the other vngodly, which be slayne: whose daye came, when their wickednesse was full.
{21:30} Though it were put vp agayne into the sheath, yet will I punysh the, in the londe where thou wast norished & borne,
{21:31} and poure my indignacion vpon the, and will blowe vpon the in the fyre of my wrath, and delyuer the vnto cruell people, which are lerned to destroye.
{21:32} Thou shalt fede the fyre, and yi bloude shall be shed in the londe, that thou mayest be put out of remembraunce. Euen I the LORDE haue spoken it.
{22:1} Morouer, the worde of ye LORDE came vnto me, & sayde:
{22:2} Thou sonne of man, wilt thou not reproue this bloudthurstie cite? Shewe the their abhominacios,
{22:3} & tell them: Thus saieth the LORDE God: O thou cite, yt sheddest bloude in ye myddest of the, yt thy tyme maye come also: and makest the Idols to defyle the withall.
{22:4} Thou hast made thy self gilty, in ye bloude yt thou hast shed: & defyled ye i ye ydols, which thou hast made. Thou hast caused thy daies to drawe nye, & made the tyme of thy yeares to come. Therfore will I make ye to be confounded amoge the Heithe, & to be despised in all the lodes,
{22:5} whether they be nye or farre fro the: they shal laugh ye to scorne, thou yt hast gotte the so foule a name, & art full off myschefe.
{22:6} Beholde, the rulers of Israel haue brought euery man his power, to shed bloude in the.
{22:7} In the haue they despised father & mother, in the haue they oppressed the strauger, in the haue they vexed the wyddowe & the fatherlesse.
{22:8} Thou hast despysed my Sactuary, and vnhalowed my Sabbath.
{22:9} Murtherers are there in the, that shed bloude, & eate vpon the hilles, and in the they vse vnhappynesse.
{22:10} In ye haue they discouered their fathers shame, in the haue they vexed women in their sicknesse.
{22:11} Euery ma hath dealte shamefully with his neghbours wife, & abhominably defyled his doughter in lawe. In the hath euery man forced his owne sister, euen his fathers doughter:
{22:12} Yee giftes haue bene receaued in the, to shed bloude. Thou hast taken vsury & encreace, thou hast oppressed thy neghbours by extorcion, and forgotten me, saieth the LORDE God.
{22:13} Beholde, I haue smytten my hondes vpo thy couetousnesse, that thou hast vsed, and vpon the bloude which hath bene shed in the.
{22:14} Is thy herte able to endure it, or maye thy hondes defende them selues, in the tyme that I shall bringe vpon the? Euen I the LORDE that speake it, will bringe it also to passe.
{22:15} I will scatre the amonge the Heithen, & strowe the aboute in the lodes, and wil cause thy fylthynesse to ceasse out off the:
{22:16} yee and I will haue the in possession in the sight of the Heithen, that thou mayest knowe, that I am the LORDE,
{22:17} And the worde off the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{22:18} Thou sonne of man, the house of Israel is turned to drosse. C All they that shulde be brasse, tynne, yro & leade, are in the fyre become drosse.
{22:19} Therfore, thus saieth the LORDE God: For so moch as ye all are turned in to drosse, beholde: I will brynge you together vnto Ierusalem,
{22:20} like as syluer, brasse, yron, tynne and leade are put together in the fornace, and the fyre blowen there vnder to melt them: Euen so will I gather you, put you in together, and melt you in my wrath and indignacion.
{22:21} I will brynge you together, and kyndle the fyre of my cruell displeasure vnder you, that ye maye be melted therin.
{22:22} Like as the syluer is melted in the fyre, so shall ye also be melted therin: that ye maye knowe, how that I the LORDE haue poured my wrath vpon you.
{22:23} And the worde off the LORDE came vnto me, sayege:
{22:24} Thou sonne of ma, tell her: Thou art an vn clene londe, which is not rayned vpon in the daye off the cruell wrath:
{22:25} thy prophetes that are in the, are sworne together to deuoure soules, like as a roaringe Lyon, that lyueth by his pray. They receaue riches and good, and make many wyddowes in ye.
{22:26} Thy prestes breake my lawe, and defyle my Sanctuary. They put no dyfference betwene the holy and vnholy, nether discerne betwene the clene and vnclene: they turne their eyes fro my Sabbathes, and I am vnhalowed amonge them.
{22:27} Thy rulers in the are like rauyshinge wolues, to shed bloude, and to destroye soules, for their owne covetous lucre.
{22:28} As for thy prophetes, they dawbe with vntempered claye, they se vanities, and prophecie lies vnto them, sayenge: the LORDE God sayeth so, where as the LORDE hath not spoken
{22:29} The people in the londe vseth wicked extorcio and robbery. They vexe the poore and nedy: and oppresse the straunger agaynst right.
{22:30} And I sought in the londe for a man, that wolde make vp the hedge, and set him self in the gappe before me in the lodes behalfe, yt I shulde not vtterly destroye it: but I coude fynde none.
{22:31} Therfore wil I poure out my cruell displeasure vpon them, and burne them in the fyre of my wrath: their owne wayes will I recompence vpo their heades, saieth the LORDE God.
{23:1} The worde off the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{23:2} Thou sonne of man, there were two wome, that had one mother:
{23:3} These (when they were yonge) beganne to playe the harlottes in Egipte. There were their brestes brussed, and the pappes off their maydenheade destroyed.
{23:4} The eldest of them was called Oola, and hir yongest sister Ooliba. These two were myne, and bare sonnes and doughters. Their names were, Samaria, and that was Oola: and Ierusalem, that was Ooliba.
{23:5} As for Oola, she beganne to go a whorynge, when I had take her to me. She was set on fyre vpon hir louers the Assirians,
{23:6} which had to do with her: euen the prynces and lordes, that were deckte in costly araye: fayre yonge men, lusty ryders of horses.
{23:7} Thus thorow hir whordome, she cleued vnto all the yonge men off Assiria: Yee she was madde vpon them, and defyled herselff with all their Idols.
{23:8} Nether ceassed she fro the fornicacio, that she vsed with the Egipcians: for in hir youth they laye wt her, they brussed the brestes of hir maydenheade, and poured their wordome vpon her.
{23:9} Wherfore, I delyuered her in to ye hodes of hir louers, euen the Assirians, whom she so loued.
{23:10} These discouered hir shame, toke hir sonnes and doughters, and slewe her with the swearde: An euell name gat she of all people, ad they punyshed her.
{23:11} Hir sister Ooliba sawe this, ad destroyed herself wt inordinate loue, more then she, & exceaded hir sister in whordome:
{23:12} she loued ye Assirians (which also laye wt her) namely, the prynces & greate lordes, that were clothed wt all maner of gorgious apparell, all lusty horsmen and fayre yonge personnes.
{23:13} Then I sawe, that they both were defyled a like.
{23:14} But she increased still in whordome: for when she sawe men paynted vpon the wall, the ymages off the Caldees set forth with fresh colours,
{23:15} with fayre gyrdles aboute them, and goodly bonettes vpon their heades, lokynge all like prynces (after ye maner of the Babilonias and Caldees in their owne londe, where they be borne).
{23:16} Inmediatly, as soone as she sawe them, she brent in loue vpon them, and sent messaugers for them in to the londe of the Caldees.
{23:17} Now when the Babilonias came to her, they laye with her, and defyled her with their whordome, and so was she poluted with with them. And when hir lust was abated from them,
{23:18} hir whordome and shame was discouered & sene: then my herte forsoke her, like as my herte was gone from hir sister also.
{23:19} Neuertheles she vsed hir whordome euer the longer the more, and remembred the dayes off hir youth, wherin she had played the harlot in the londe off Egipte:
{23:20} she brent in lust vpon them, whose flesh was like ye flesh of Asses, and their sede like the sede off horses.
{23:21} Thus thou hast renued the fylthynesse of thy youth, when thy louers bressed yi pappes, and marred thy brestes in Egipte.
{23:22} Therfore (o Ooliba) thus saieth ye LORDE God. I will rayse vp thy louers (with whom thou hast satisfied thy lust) agaynst the, and gather them together rounde aboute the:
{23:23} Namely, the Babilonians, and all the Caldees: Pecod, Schoa and Coa, with all the Assirians: all yonge and fayre louers: prynces and lordes, knyghtes and gentlemen, which be all good horsmen:
{23:24} These shall come vpon the with horses, charettes, & a greate multitude of people: which shal be harnessed aboute the on euery syde, wt brestplates, sheldes and helmettes. I will punysh ye before them, yee they the selues shal punysh the, acordinge to their owne iudgmet.
{23:25} I will put my gelousy vpon the, so that they shall deale cruelly with the. They shal cut of thy nose and thine eares, and the remnaunt shall fall thorow the swearde. They shall cary awaye thy sonnes and doughters, & the resydue shalbe brent in the fyre.
{23:26} Thy shal strype the out of thy clothes, & cary thy costly Iewels awaye with them.
{23:27} Thus will I make an ende off thy fylthynesse & whordome, which thou hast brought out of the lode of Egipte: so that thou shalt turne thine eyes nomore after them, & cast thy mynde nomore vpon Egipte.
{23:28} For thus saieth the LORDE: Beholde, I will delyuer ye in to the hodes of them, whom thou hatest: yee euen in to the hondes of them, with who thou hast fulfylled thy lust,
{23:29} which shall deale cruelly with ye: All thy laboure shal they take with them, and leaue the naked and bare, and thus the shame of thy filthy whordome shal come to light.
{23:30} All these thinges shal happen vnto the, because of thy whordome, which thou hast vsed amonge the Gentiles, with whose Idols thou hast defyled yi self.
{23:31} Thou hast walked in the waye of thy sister, therfore will I geue the hir cuppe in thy honde.
{23:32} Thus saieth the LORDE God: Thou shalt drynke off thy sisters cuppe, how depe & farre so euer it be to the botome. Thou shalt be laughed to scorne, and had as greatly in derision, as is possible.
{23:33} Thou shalt be full off dronckennes and sorowe, for the cuppe of yi sister Samaria is a cuppe of destruccion & waistinge:
{23:34} the same shalt thou drynke, and suppe it out eue to ye dregges, yee thou shalt eate vp the broken peces off it, and so teare thine owne brestes: For euen I haue spoken it, saieth the LORDE God.
{23:35} Therfore thus saieth ye LORDE God: For so moch as thou hast forgotte me, & cast me asyde, so beare now thine owne fylthinesse & whordome.
{23:36} The LORDE sayde morouer vnto me: Thou sonne of ma, wilt thou not reproue Oola & Ooliba? Shewe the their abhominacios:
{23:37} namely, yt they haue broke their wedlocke, & stayned their hodes wt bloude: yee euen wt their Idols haue they committed aduoutry, & offred them their owne children (to be deuoured) who they had borne vnto me.
{23:38} Yee & this haue they done vnto me also: they haue defyled my Sactuary in that same daye, & haue vnhalowed my Sabbath.
{23:39} For when they had slayne their childre for their Idols, they came the same daye in to my Sanctuary, to defyle it. Lo, this haue they done in my house.
{23:40} Besyde all this, thou hast sent yi messaungers for men out of farre coutrees: and whe they came, thou hast bathed, trymmed and set forth thy selff off the best fashion:
{23:41} thou sattest vpo a goodly bed, & a table spred before the: whervpon thou hast set myne incense and myne oyle.
{23:42} Then was there greate cheare wt her, & the men yt were sent fro farre coutrees ouer the deserte: vnto these they gaue bracelettes vpon their hondes, & set glorious crownes vpon their heades.
{23:43} Then thought I: no doute, these wil vse their harlotry also wt yoder olde whore.
{23:44} And they wente in to her, as vnto a comon harlot: Euen so wente they also to Oola & Ooliba, those filthy women.
{23:45} O ye all that loue vertue and rightuousnes, iudge the, punysh them: as aduoutrers and murtherers ought to be iudged and punyshed. For they are breakers off wedlocke, and the bloude is in their hondes.
{23:46} Wherfore thus saieth the LORDE God: bringe a greate multitude off people vpon them, and make them be scatred and spoyled:
{23:47} these shal stone them, and gorre them with their sweardes. They shal slaye their sonnes and doughters and burne vp their houses with fyre.
{23:48} Thus will I destroye all soch fylthynes out off the londe: that all women may lerne, not to do after youre vnclenesse.
{23:49} And so they shall laye youre fylthinesse vpon youre owne selues, and ye shalbe punyshed for the synnes, that ye haue committed with youre Idols: & ye shall knowe, that I am the LORDE.
{24:1} In the ix. yeare, in the x. Moneth. the x. daye off the Moneth, came the worde off the LORDE vnto me, sayenge:
{24:2} O thou sonne off man, wryte vp the name off this daye, yee eue ye houre of this present daye: when the kynge of Babilon set himself agaynst Ierusale.
{24:3} Shewe yt obstinate housholde a parable, & speake vnto the: Thus sayet the LORDE God: Get the a pot, set it on, & poure water in to it:
{24:4} put all the peces together in it, all the good peces: the loyne and the shulder, & fyll it with the best bones.
{24:5} Take one off the best shepe, & an heape off bones withall: let it boyle well, & let the bones seyth well therin.
{24:6} With that, sayde the LORDE God on this maner: Wo be vnto the bloudy cite of ye pot, whervpon the rustynesse hageth, and is not yet scoured awaye. Take out the peces that are in it, one after another: there nede no lottes be cast therfore,
{24:7} for the bloude is yet in it Vpon a playne drye stone hath she poured it, and not vpon the grounde, that it might be couered with dust.
{24:8} And therfore haue I letten her poure hir bloude vpon a playne drye stony rocke, because it shulde not be hid, and that I might bringe my wrothfull indignacion and vengeaunce vpon her.
{24:9} Wherfore, thus saieth ye LORDE God: O, wo be vnto that bloudthurstie cite, for who I wil prepare a heape off wodde:
{24:10} beare thou ye bones together, kyndle thou the fyre, seeth the flesh, let all be well sodde, that the bones maye be suckte out.
{24:11} Morouer, set the pot emptye vpon the coales, that it maye be warme and the metall hote: that the fylth and rustynesse maye be consumed.
{24:12} But it will not go off, there is so moch off it: the rustinesse must be brent out.
{24:13} Thy filthinesse is abhominable, for I wolde haue clensed the, but thou woldest not be clensed. Thou canst not be pourged from thine vnclennesse, till I haue poured my wrothfull indignacion vpon the.
{24:14} Euen I the LORDE haue so deuysed: Yee it is come therto allredy, that I will do it. I will not go backe, I will not spare, I wil not be intreated: but acordinge to thy wayes ad ymaginacions, thou shalt be punyshed, saieth the LORDE God.
{24:15} And the worde off the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{24:16} Thou sonne off man, beholde, I will take awaye the pleasure off thine eyes wt a plage: yet shalt thou nether mourne ner wepe, ner water thy chekes therfore:
{24:17} thou mayest mourne by thy selff alone, but vse no deadly lamentacion. Holde on thy bonet, and put on thy shues vpon thy fete, couer not thy face, and eate no mourners bred.
{24:18} So I spake vnto the people bytymes in the mornynge, and at euen my wyfe dyed: then vpon the nexte morow, I dyd as I was comaunded.
{24:19} And ye people sayde vnto me: wilt thou not tell vs, what that signifieth, which thou doest?
{24:20} I answered them, the worde off the LORDE came vnto me, sayege:
{24:21} Tell the house of Israel, thus saieth ye LODDE God: beholde, I wil suspende my Sanctuary: eue the glory of youre power, the pleasure of yor eyes, and the thinge that ye loue: youre sonnes and doughters whom ye haue left, shal fall thorow the swerde.
{24:22} Like as I haue done, so shall ye do also: Ye shal not hyde youre faces, ye shal eate no mourners bred:
{24:23} youre bonettes shal ye haue vpon youre heades, & shues vpon youre fete Ye shal nether mourne ner wepe, but in youre synnes ye shal be soroufull, and one repete with another.
{24:24} Thus Ezechiel is youre shewtoke. For loke as he hath done, so (when this commeth) ye shall do also: that ye maye lerne to knowe, that I am ye LORDE God.
{24:25} But beholde, O thou sonne of man: In the daye when I take from them their power, their ioye and honoure, the lust off their eyes, the burthe of their bodies: namely, their sonnes and doughters:
{24:26} The shall there one escape, and come vnto the, for to shewe the.
{24:27} In that daye shal yi mouth be opened to him, which is escaped, that thou mayest speake, and be nomore domme: Yee and thou shalt be their shewtoke, that they maye knowe, how that I am the LORDE.
{25:1} The worde of the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{25:2} Thou sonne of man, set thy face agaynst ye Ammonites, prophecy vpon them,
{25:3} and saye vnto the Ammonites: Heare the worde off the LORDE God, Thus saieth the LORDE God: For so moch as thou speakest ouer my Sanctuary: A ha, I trow it be now suspended: and ouer the londe of Israel, I trow it be now desolate: yee ad ouer the house of Iuda, I trow they be now led awaye presoners:
{25:4} Beholde, I will delyuer ye to the people of the east, yt they maye haue the in possession: these shal set their castels and houses in the. They shall eate thy frute, and drynke vp thy mylcke.
{25:5} As for Rabath, I wil make of it a stall for camels, and of Ammon a shepefolde: and ye shal knowe, that I am the LORDE.
{25:6} For thus saieth the LORDE God: In so moch as thou hast clapped with thine hondes, and stamped with thy fete, yee reioysed in thine herte ouer the londe of Israel with despyte:
{25:7} beholde, I wil stretch out myne hode ouer the also, and delyuer the, to be spoyled off the Heithen, and rote the out from amonge the people, and cause the be destroyed out off all londes: yee I will make the be layed waist, that thou mayest knowe, that I am the LORDE.
{25:8} Thus saieth ye LORDE God: For so moch as Moab and Seir do saye: As for the house off Iuda, it is but like as all other Getiles be:
{25:9} Therfore beholde, I will make the cities off Moab weapenlesse, and take awaye their strength: their cities and chefe coastes off their londe, which are the pleasures off the countre: As namely. Betiesimoth, Baalmeo and Cariathaim:
{25:10} these will I open vnto the off the east, yt they maye fall vpon the Ammonites: and will geue it them in possession: so that the Ammonites shal no more be had in remebraunce amonge the Heithen.
{25:11} Euen thus will I punysh Moab also, that they maye knowe, how that I am the LORDE.
{25:12} Morouer, thus sayeth the LORDE God: Because that Edom hath avenged & eased himself vpon the house off Iuda,
{25:13} therfore thus saieth the LORDE: I will reach out myne honde vpon Edom, and take awaye man and beest out off it. From Thema vnto Dedan wil I make it desolate, they shalbe slayne with the swearde.
{25:14} Thorow my people of Israel, wil I avenge me agayne vpo Edo: they shal hadle him, acordinge to my wrath and indignacio, so that they shal knowe my vengeaunce, saieth the LORDE God.
{25:15} Thus saieth ye LORDE God: For so moch as the Philistynes haue done this: namely, taken vengeaunce with despitefull stomackes, and off an olde euell will set them selues to destroye:
{25:16} Therfore thus saieth the LORDE God: Beholde, I wil stretch out myne hode ouer the Philistynes, and destroye the destroyer, and cause all the remnaunt off the see coast to perish.
{25:17} A greate vengeaunce will I take vpon them, and punysh them cruelly: that they maye knowe, how that I am the LORDE, which haue avenged me off them.
{26:1} It happened, that in the xi. yeare, the first daye off the Moneth, the worde of the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{26:2} Thou sonne of man, Because that Tyre hath spoken vpon Ierusalem: A ha, now I trow the portes of the people be broken, and she turned vnto me, for I haue destroyed my bely full.
{26:3} Yee therfore saieth ye LORDE God: Beholde O Tyre, I will vpo the, I wil bringe a greate multitude off people agaynst ye, like as whe the see aryseth with his wawes:
{26:4} These shal breake the walles off Tyre, and cast downe hir towres: I wil scrape the grounde from her, and make her a bare stone:
{26:5} yee as the dryenge place, where the fyshers hange vp their nettes by the see syde. Euen I haue spoken it, sayeth the LORDE God. The Getiles shal spoyle her:
{26:6} hir doughters vpon the felde shall perish with the swearde, yt they maye knowe, how that I am the LORDE.
{26:7} For thus saieth the LORDE God: Beholde, I will brynge hither Nabuchodonosor (which is the kynge off Babilon & a kynge of kynges) from the North, vpo Tyre, with horses, charettes, horsmen and with a greate multitude of people.
{26:8} Thy doughters that are in the londe, shal he slaye with ye swearde: But agaynst ye, he shall make bullworkes & graue vp dyches aboute the, & lift vp his shylde agaynst ye.
{26:9} His slynges & batelrames shal he prepare for thy walles, & wt his weapes breake downe thy towres.
{26:10} The dust of his horses shal couer ye, they shalbe so many: ye walles shal shake at the noyse of ye horse men, charettes & wheles: when he cometh to thy portes, as men do into an open cite.
{26:11} With the hoffes off his horse fete, shal he treade downe all thy stretes. He shal slaye thy people wt the swearde, & breake downe the pilers of thy strength.
{26:12} They shal waist awaye thy riches, & spoyle yi marchaudise. Thy walles shal they breake downe, & destroye thy houses of pleasure. Thy stones, thy tymbre & foundacions, shall they cast in the water.
{26:13} Thus wil I brynge the melody of thy songes, & the voyce of thy mynstrelsy to an ende, so that they shal nomore be herde.
{26:14} I wil make a bare stone off the, yee a dryenge place for nettes, and shalt neuer be buylded agayne: For eue I ye LORDE haue spoken it, sayeth the LORDE God:
{26:15} thus hath the LORDE God spoken concernynge Tyre: The Iles shall be moued at the noyse off thy fall, & at the crie of the slayne, yt shalbe murthured in the.
{26:16} All kynges off the see shall come downe from their seates regall: they shal laye awaye their roabes, and put off their costly clothinge: Yee with tremblinge shal they be clothed, they shall syt vpo the grounde: they shal be afrayed at thy sodane fall, and be abasshed at the.
{26:17} They shal mourne for the, and saye vnto the: O thou noble cite, yt hast bene so greatly occupyed off olde, thou that hast bene the strongest vpon the see wt thine inhabitours off whom all men stode in feare: How art thou now so vtterly destroyed?
{26:18} Now at the tyme off thy fall the inhabitours off the Iles, yee and the Iles them selues shall stonde in feare at thine ende.
{26:19} For thus sayeth the LORDE God: when I make the a desolate cite (as other cities be, that no man dwell in) and when I brynge the depe vpon the, yt greate waters maye couer the:
{26:20} Then will I cast the downe vnto them, that descende into ye pytte: vnto a people that hath bene loge deed, and set the in a londe yt is beneth, like the olde wyldernes, with them which go downe to their graues, so yt no ma shal dwell more in the. And I wil make the to be no more in honor, in the lode of the lyuynge.
{26:21} I wil make an ende off the, ad thou shalt be gone. Though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou not be founde for euermore, saieth ye LORDE God.
{27:1} The worde off the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{27:2} O thou sonne off ma, make a lamentable coplaynte vpon Tyre,
{27:3} & saye vnto Tyre, which is a porte off the see, yt occupieth with moch people: and many Iles: thus speaketh ye LORDE God: O Tyre thou hast sayde: what, I am a noble cite.
{27:4} thy borders are in the myddest of the see, and thy buylders haue made the maruelous goodly.
{27:5} All yi tables haue they made of Cipre trees of the mount Senir. Fro Libanus haue they take Cedre trees, to make the mastes:
{27:6} & the Okes of Basan to make the rowers. Thy boordes haue they made of yuery, & of costly wod out of the Ile of Cethim.
{27:7} Thy sale was of whyte small nedle worke out off the londe of Egipte, to hage vpo thy mast: & thy hanginges of yalow sylcke & purple, out of ye Iles of Elisa.
{27:8} They of Sido & Arnad were thy maryners, & the wysest in Tyre were thy shypmasters.
{27:9} The eldest and wysest at Gebal were they, that mended & stopped thy shippes. All shippes off the see with their shipme occupied their marchaundies in the.
{27:10} The Perses, Lydians and Lybians were in thyne hoost, and helped the to fight: these hanged vp their shildes & helmettes with the, these set forth thy beuty.
{27:11} They off Arnad were with thine hoost roude aboute thy walles, & were thy watchmen vpon thy towres: these hanged vp their shildes roude aboute thy walles, and made the maruelous goodly.
{27:12} Tharsis occupide with the in all maner of wares, in syluer, yron, tynne and lead, and made thy market greate.
{27:13} Iauan, Tubal and Mesech were thy marchauntes, which brought the men, & ornamentes off metall for thy occupyenge.
{27:14} They off the house of Thogarma brought vnto the at the tyme off thy Marte, horse, horsmen and mules.
{27:15} They off Dedan were thy marchautes: and many other Iles that occupyed with the, brought the wethers, elephat bones and Paycockes for a present
{27:16} The Sirians occupied with the, because of thy dyuerse workes, and increased thy marchaundies, with Smaragdes, with scarlet, with nedle worke, wt whyte lynninge cloth, with sylcke and with Christall.
{27:17} Iuda and the londe off Israel occupide with the, and brought vnto thy markettes, wheate, balme, hony, oyle, & triacle.
{27:18} Damascus also vsed marchaudies with the, in the best wyne and whyte woll: because thy occupienge was so greate, and thy wares so many.
{27:19} Dan, Iauan, and Meusal haue brought vnto thy markettes, yron redy made, with Casia and Calamus, acordinge to thyne occupienge.
{27:20} Dedan occupied with the, in fayre tapestry worke and quyshyns.
{27:21} Arabia & all the princes off Cedar haue occupied wt the, in shepe, wethers and goates.
{27:22} The marchauntes off Seba and Rema haue occupied also with the, in all costly spices, in all precious stones and golde, which they brought vnto thy marckettes.
{27:23} Haran, Chene and Eden, the marchauntes off Saba, Assiria and Chelmad, were all doers with ye
{27:24} and occupied with the: In costly rayment, off yalow sylke and nedle worke, (very precious, & therfore packte & boude together wt roapes) Yee and in Cedre wodde, at the tyme off yi marckettes.
{27:25} The shippes of Tharsis were the chefe off thy occupienge. Thus thou art full, and in greate worshipe, euen in the myddest off the see.
{27:26} Thy maryners were euer brynginge vnto the out of many waters. But ye easte wynde shal ouerbeare the in to the myddest off the see:
{27:27} so yt thy wares, thy marchaudies, thy ryches, thy maryners, thy shipmasters, thy helpers, thy occupiers (that brought the thinges necessary) the men off warre that are in the: yee and all thy comons shall perish in the myddest off the see, in the daye off thy fall.
{27:28} The suburbes shall shake at the loude crie off thy shippmen.
{27:29} All whirry men, and all maryners vpo the see, shall leape out of their boates, and set them selues vpon the lode.
{27:30} They shal lift vp their voyce because off the, and make a lamentable crye. They shall cast dust vpon their heades, ad lye downe in the asshes.
{27:31} They shal shaue them selues, & put sacke cloth vpon them for thy sake. They shall mourne for the with hertfull sorow,
{27:32} and heuy lamentacion, yee their children also shall wepe for the: Alas, what cite hath so bene destroyed in the see, as Tyre is?
{27:33} When thy wares & marchaundies came fro the sees thou gauest all people ynough. The kynges off the earth hast thou made rich, thorow the multitude off thy wares and occupienge:
{27:34} But now art thou cast downe in to the depe of the see, all thy resorte of people is perished with the.
{27:35} All they that dwell in the Iles are abasshed at the, and all their kynges are afrayed, yee their faces haue chaunged coloure.
{27:36} The marchauntes of the nacions wondre at the, In that thou art so clene brought to naught, & comest nomore vp.
{28:1} The worde of the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{28:2} Thou sonne of man, tell the prynce of Tyre: Thus saieth the LORDE God: because thou hast a proude hert and hast sayde: I am a God, I haue my seate in the myddest off the see like a god: where as thou art but a man & not God, & yet stondest in thine owne coceate, that thou art God:
{28:3} Beholde, thou thynkest thy selfe wyser then Daniel, that there is no secretes hyd from ye.
{28:4} With thy wisdome & thy vnderstodinge, thou hast gotte the greate welthynesse, and gathered treasure of syluer & golde.
{28:5} With thy greate wisdome and occupienge, hast thou increased thy power, and because of thy greate riches thy hert is proude.
{28:6} Therfore thus saieth ye LORDE God: For so moch as thou hast lift vp thine herte, as though thou werst God:
{28:7} beholde, I wil bringe enemies vpon the, euen the tyrauntes of the Heithe: these shal drawe out their sweardes vpon thy beuty and wisdome, and shall defyle thy glory.
{28:8} They shal cast the downe to the pytte, so that thou shalt dye in the middest of the see,
{28:9} as they that be slayne. Let se, yff thou wilt saye then (before the that slaye ye) I am God: where as thou art but a man, and not God, in the hondes of them that slaye the.
{28:10} Dye shalt thou, euen as the vncircumcised in the hodes of ye enemies: for I myself haue spoken it, saieth the LORDE God.
{28:11} Morouer, the worde off the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{28:12} Thou sonne off man, make a lamentable complaynte ouer the kynge of Tyre, & tell him: Thus saieth the LORDE God: Thou art a seale of a licknesse, full off wysdome & excellent beuty.
{28:13} Thou hast bene in ye pleasaut garde off God: thou art decte with all maner of precious stones: with Ruby, Topas, Christall, Iacyncte, Onyx, Iaspis, Saphir, Smaragde, Carbucle, & golde. Thy beuty & ye holes yt be in ye were set forth in the daye of yi creacion.
{28:14} Thou art a fayre Cherub, stretched wyde out for to couer. I haue set the vpon the holy mount off God, there hast thou bene, and walked amoge the fayre glisteringe stones.
{28:15} From the tyme of thy creacion thou hast bene right excellent, tyll wickednesse was founde in the.
{28:16} Because off thy greate marchaundise, thy hert is full of wickednesse, & thou hast offended. Therfore wil I cast the from the mount of God, (O thou coueringe Cherub) and destroye the amoge the glisteringe stones.
{28:17} Thy hert was proude in yi fayre beuty, & thorow thy beuty thou hast destroyed thy wisdome. I will cast ye downe to the grounde, & yt in ye sight of kynges.
{28:18} Thou hast defyled thy Sactuary, wt the greate wickednesse off thy onrightuous occupyenge. I wil bringe a fyre from the myddest of the, to consume the: ad wil make the to asshes, in the sight of all the yt loke vpon the.
{28:19} All they that haue bene acquaunted with the amonge the Heithe, shalbe abasshed at the: seinge thou art so clene brought to naught, and comest no more vp.
{28:20} And the worde off the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{28:21} Thou sonne of man, set thy face agaynst Sido, Prophecie vpo it,
{28:22} and speake. Thus saieth the LORDE God: Beholde o Sidon, I wil vpo the, & get me honoure in the: that it maye be knowne, how that I am ye LORDE, when I punysh her, & get me honoure in her.
{28:23} For I will sende pestilence & bloudsheddinge in to hir stretes, so yt those which be slayne with the swerde, shal lye rounde aboute in the myddest of her: & they shal knowe, that I am the LORDE.
{28:24} She shal no more be a prickinge thorne, & an hurtinge brere vnto the house of Israel, ner vnto the that lye rounde aboute her and hate her: and they shal knowe, that I am the LORDE.
{28:25} Thus saieth the LORDE God: when I gather the housholde of Israel together agayne, from the nacions amonge whom they be scatred: then shal I be sanctified in the, in ye sight of the Getiles: & they shal dwell in the lode, yt I gaue to my seruaunt Iacob.
{28:26} They shal dwell safely therin, buylde houses, and plante vynyardes: Yee safely shal they dwell therin, when I haue punyshed all those, that despyse them rounde aboute: and then shall they knowe, yt I am the LORDE their God.
{29:1} In the x. yeare, vpon the xij. daye off the x. Moneth, the worde of the LORDE came vnto me, sayege:
{29:2} O thou sonne off ma, set now thy face agaynst Pharao the kynge off Egipte, Prophecye agaynst him and agaynst the whole lode of Egipte:
{29:3} Speake, and tell him, thus saieth the LORDE God: beholde, o Pharao thou kinge of Egipte, I wil vpo the, thou greate whall fysh, yt lyest in yi waters: Thou yt sayest: the water is myne, I haue made it myself.
{29:4} I wil put an hoke in thy chawes, & hage all the fish in thy waters vpo thy skales: after yt I wil drawe the out of thy waters, yee & all the fish, of ye waters that hange vpon thy skales.
{29:5} I wil cast the out vpon the dry lode with the fish of thy waters, so that thou shalt lye vpon the felde. Thou shalt not be gathered ner taken vp, but shalt be meate for the beestes of the felde, & for the foules off the ayre:
{29:6} that all they which dwell in Egipte, maye knowe, that I am the LORDE: because thou hast bene a staff of rede to the house of Israel.
{29:7} When they toke holde of ye wt their hode thou brakest and prycdest them on euery syde: and yff they leaned vpo the, thou brakest, ad hurtdest the reynes of their backes.
{29:8} Therfore, thus sayeth the LORDE: God: beholde, I will brynge a swearde vpon the, and rote out of the both man and beest.
{29:9} Yee the londe of Egipte shalbe desolate and waist, & they shal knowe, that I am the LORDE: Because he sayde: the water is mine, I my self haue made it.
{29:10} Beholde therfore, I wil vpon the, & vpon thy waters: I will make the londe off Egipte waist and desolate, from the towre of Syenes vnto the borders of the Morias londe:
{29:11} so that in xl. yeares there shall no fote off man walke there, nether fote of catell go there, nether shal it be inhabited.
{29:12} I wil make the londe of Egipte to be desolate amonge other waist countrees, and her cities to lye voyde xl. yeares, amonge other voyde cities: And I wil scatre the Egipcians amonge the Heithen and nacions.
{29:13} Agayne, thus sayeth the LORDE God: Whe the xl. yeares are expyred, I wil gather the Egipcians together agayne, out off the nacios, amonge who they were scatred,
{29:14} and wil bringe the presoners off Egipte agayne in to the londe off Pathures their owne natyue countre, that they maye be there a lowly small kyngdome:
{29:15} yee they shal be the smallest amonge other kyngdomes, lest they exalte them selues aboue the Heithen: for I will so mynish them,
{29:16} that they shall nomore rule the Heithen. They shall nomore be an hope vnto the house off Israel, nether prouoke the enymore to wickednesse, to cause them turne backe, and to folowe them: ad they shal knowe, that I am the LORDE God.
{29:17} In the xxvij. yeare, the first daye of the first Moneth, came ye worde off the LORDE vnto me, sayenge:
{29:18} Thou sonne off man, Nabuchodonosor the kynge off Babilon hath made his hoost, with greate trauayle and laboure to come before Tyre: that euery heade maye be balde, and euery shulder bare. Yet hath Tyre geuen nether him ner his hoost eny rewarde, for ye greate trauayle yt he hath taken there.
{29:19} Therfore thus saieth ye LORDE God: beholde I will geue the lode of Egipte vnto Nabuchodonosor the kynge off Babilo, yt he maye take awaye all hir substauce, robbe hir robberies, ad spoyle hir spoyles, to paye his hoost their wagies withall.
{29:20} I wil geue him the londe of Egipte for his laboure, that he toke for me before Tyre.
{29:21} At the same tyme wil I cause the horne off the house of Israel to growe forth, & open thy mouth agayne amonge them: that they maye knowe, how that I am the LORDE.
{30:1} Morouer, the worde off the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{30:2} Thou sonne of man, prophecy & speake: thus saieth the LORDE God: Mourne, wo worth this daye,
{30:3} for the daye is here, the daye of ye LORDE is come: the darcke daye of ye Heithe the houre is at honde,
{30:4} the swearde commeth vpon Egipte. When the wounded men fall downe in Egipte, when hir people are taken awaye, and when hir foundacios are destroyed:
{30:5} the Morians londe shal be afrayed, yee the Morians londe, Lybia & Lydia, all their comon people, & Chub, & all yt be confederate vnto the, shal fall wt the thorow ye swearde.
{30:6} Thus saieth ye LORDE: The maynteyners of the lode of Egipte shall fall, the pryde of hir power shal come downe: eue vnto the tower off Syenes shall they be slayne downe wt the swearde, saieth ye LORDE God:
{30:7} amonge other desolate countrees they shal be made desolate, & amoge other waist cities they shalbe waisted.
{30:8} And they shal knowe, yt I am ye LORDE, when I kyndle a fyre in Egipte, & when all hir helpers are destroyed.
{30:9} At that tyme, shal there messaungers go forth fro me in shippes, to make ye carelesse Morians afrayed: and sorowe shal come vpon them in the daye of Egipte, for doutles it shal come.
{30:10} Thus saieth the LORDE God: I wil make an ende of the people of Egipte thorow the honde of Nabuchodosor kynge of Babilon.
{30:11} He and his people with him, yee and the cruell tyrauntes of the Heithen shalbe brought to destroye the londe. They shal drawe out their sweardes vpon Egipte and fyll the londe full of slayne men.
{30:12} I will drye vp their floudes of water, ad sell the lode in to the hondes of wicked people. The lode and all yt is therin, wil I destroye thorow the enemies. Eue I the LORDE haue sayde it.
{30:13} And thus saieth the LORDE God: I will destroye the Idols, and brynge the ymages of Noph to an ende. There shal no more be a prynce of Egypte, and a fearfulnesse will I sende in to the Egipcians londe.
{30:14} As for Pathures, I wil make it desolate, ad kyndle a fyre in Zoan. Alexandria will I punysh,
{30:15} & poure my wrothfull indignacio vpo Sin, which is the strength of Egipte. All the sustaunce of Alexandria will I destroye,
{30:16} and kyndle a fyre in Egipte. Sin shalbe in greate heuynesse, Alexandria shalbe roted out and Noph shall haue daylie sorowe.
{30:17} The best men off Heliopolis & Bubasto shalbe slayne with the swearde ad caried awaye captyue.
{30:18} At Taphnis the daye shalbe darcke, when I breake there the scepter of the londe of Egipte, and when ye pompe of hir powr shal haue an ende. A cloude shal couer her, and hir doughters shalbe led awaye in to captyuyte.
{30:19} Thus will I punysh Egipte, that they maye knowe, how that I am the LORDE.
{30:20} It happened in the xi. yeare, vpon the seueth daye of ye first Moneth, yt the LORDES worde came vnto me, sayege:
{30:21} Beholde, thou sonne of ma, I wil breake ye arme of Pharao kynge of Egipte: and lo, it shal not be boude vp to be healed, nether shal eny playstre be layed vpon it, for to ease it, or to make it so stroge, as to holde a swearde.
{30:22} Therfore, thus saieth the LORDE God: beholde, I will vpon Pharao ye kinge of Egipte, & brusse his stroge arme (yet is it but a broken one) & will smyte the swearde out of his honde.
{30:23} As for the Egipcians, I wil scatre them amonge the Heithen, & strowe the in the londes aboute.
{30:24} Agayne I will strength ye arme of the kinge of Babilo, & geue him my swearde in his hode: but I wil breake Pharaos arme, so yt he shal holde it before him piteously, like a wounded man.
{30:25} Yee I will stablish the kynge of Babilos arme, & the armes of Pharao shal fall downe: that it maye be knowne, that I am the LORDE, which geue the kynge off Babilon my swearde in his hode, that he maye drawe it out vpon the londe of Egipte:
{30:26} and that when I scatre the Egipcians amonge the Gentiles, and strowe them in ye lodes aboute, they maye knowe, yt I am the LORDE.
{31:1} Morouer, it happened in the xi. yeare ye first daye of the thirde Moneth, that the worde of the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{31:2} Thou sonne of man, speake vnto Pharao the kynge of Egipte, ad to all his people: Whom art thou like in yi greatnesse?
{31:3} Beholde, Assur was like a Cedre tre vpo the mount of Libanus, with fayre brauches: so thicke, that he gaue shadowes, and shot out very hye. His toppe reached vnto the cloudes.
{31:4} The waters made him greate, and the depe set him vp an hye. Roude aboute the rotes of him rane there floudes of water, he sent out his litle ryuers vnto all the trees of the felde.
{31:5} Therfore was he hyer the all the trees of the felde, and thorow ye multitude of waters that he sent fro him, he optayned many and longe braunches.
{31:6} All foules of the ayre made their nestes in his brauches, vnder his bowes gedred all the beastes of ye felde, & vnder his shadow dwelt all people.
{31:7} Fayre and beutifull was he in his greatnesse, and in the length of his braunches, for his rote stode besyde greate waters:
{31:8} no Cedre tre might hyde him. In the pleasaut garden of God, there was no Fyrre tre like his brauches, the playne trees were not like ye bowes of him. All the trees in the garden off God might not be copared vnto him in his beuty:
{31:9} so fayre and goodly had I made him with the multitude of his braunches: In so moch, yt all the trees in the pleasaut garde of God, had envye at hi.
{31:10} Therfore, thus saieth the LORDE God: For so moch as he hath lift vp himself so hie, & stretched his toppe in to the cloudes, & seinge his hert is proude in his highnesse:
{31:11} I wil delyuer him in to ye hondes of ye mightiest amoge ye Heithe, which shall rote him out. Acordige to his wickednes will I cast him awaye,
{31:12} the enemies shal destroye him, & the mighty men of the Heithen shall so scatre him, that his braunches shal lye vpon all mountaynes & in all valleys: his bowes shall be broken downe to the grounde thorow out the londe. Then all the people of the londe shal go from his shadowe, and forsake him.
{31:13} When he is falle, all ye foules of ye ayre shal syt vpon him, and all wilde beestes of the felde shal go aboute amonge his brauches:
{31:14} so that from hence forth, no tre in the water shall attayne to his hyenesse, nor reach his toppe vnto the cloudes, nether shall eny tre off the water stonde so hye, as he hath done. For vnto death shall they all be delyuered vnder the earth, and go downe to ye graue, like other men.
{31:15} Morouer, thus saieth the LORDE God: In the daye when he goeth downe to the graue, I will cause a lamentacion to be made. I will couer the depe vpon him, I will staunch his floudes, and the greate waters shalbe restrayned. I shall cause Libanus to be soroufull for his sake, and all the trees off the felde shall be smytte.
{31:16} I wil make the Heithen shake at the sounde of his fall, when I cast him downe to hell, with them yt descende in to the pytte. All the trees of Eden, wt all the chosen and best trees of Libanus, yee and all they that are planted vpon the waters, shal mourne with him also in the lower habitacios:
{31:17} for they shal go downe to hell wt him, vnto the that be slayne with the swearde, which dwelt afore vnder the shadow off his arme amoge the Heithe.
{31:18} To whom shalt thou be lickened, that art so glorious & greate, amonge the trees off Eden? Yet art thou cast downe vnder ye earth (amonge the trees off Eden) where thou must lye amonge the vncircumcised, with them that be slayne wt the swearde. Euen thus is it with Pharao & all his people, saieth the LORDE God.
{32:1} In the xij. yeare, the first daye of the xij. Moneth, the worde of the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{32:2} Thou sonne of man, take vp a lamentacion vpo Pharao the kynge of Egipte, & saye vnto him: Thou art reputed as a Lyon of the Heithen, & as a whalfish in the see. Thou castest yi waters aboute the, thou troublest the waters wt thy fete, and stampest in their floudes.
{32:3} Thus sayeth the LORDE God: I wil sprede my net ouer ye, namely, a greate multitude of people: these shal dryue the into my yarne,
{32:4} for I will cast the vpo the lode, and let the lye vpo the felde, that all the foules of the ayre maye syt vpo the: I wil geue all the beastes of the felde ynough off the.
{32:5} Thy flesh will I cast vpo the hilles, and fyll the valleys with thy hyenesse.
{32:6} I will water the londe with the abundaunce off thy bloude euen to the moutaynes, & ye valleys shal be full off the.
{32:7} When thou art put out, I will couer the heauen, and make his starres dymme. I will sprede a cloude ouer the Sonne, ad the Moone shall not geue hir light.
{32:8} All the lightes off heauen will I put out ouer the, and bringe darcknesse vpon thy londe, saieth ye LORDE God.
{32:9} I wil trouble the hertes off many people, when I bringe thy destruccion amoge the Heithen and countrees, whom thou knowest not.
{32:10} Yee I will make many people with their kynges so afrayed thorow ye, that their hayre shal stonde vp, whe I shake my swearde at their faces. Sodenly shal they be astonnyed, euery man in him self, at ye daye of thy fall.
{32:11} For thus saieth the LORDE God: the kynge of Babilons swearde shal come vpon ye,
{32:12} with ye sweardes of the worthies will I smyte downe thy people. All they that be mightie amonge the Getiles, shal waist the proude pompe of Egipte, and brynge downe all hir people.
{32:13} All the catell also of Egipte wil I destroye, that they shal come nomore vpo the waters: so that nether mas fote ner beastes clawe, shal stere them enymore.
{32:14} Then wil I make their waters cleare, and cause their floudes to runne like oyle, sayeth the LORDE God:
{32:15} when I make the londe of Egipte desolate, and when ye countre with all that is therin, shalbe layde waist: and whe I smyte all the which dwell in it, that they maye knowe, that I am the LORDE.
{32:16} This is the mournynge, that the doughters off the Heithen shall make: Yee a sorow and lamentacio shal they take vp, vpon Egipte and all hir people, saieth the LORDE God.
{32:17} In the xij. yeare, the xv. daye of the Moneth, came the worde off the LORDE vnto me sayenge:
{32:18} Thou sonne of man. Take vp a lamentacion vpon the people of Egipte, and cast them downe, yee ad the mightie people of the Heithe also, euen with the that dwell beneth: and with them that go downe in to the graue.
{32:19} Downe (how fayre so euer thou be) and laye the with the vncircircumcised.
{32:20} Amoge those that be slayne with the swearde, shal they lye. The swearde is geuen alredy. he shal be drawen forth and all his people.
{32:21} The mightie worthies and his helpers, yt be gone downe and lye with the vncircumcised and with them that be slayne with ye swearde: shal speake to him out of the hell.
{32:22} Assur is there also with his company, ad their graues rounde aboute, which were slayne ad fell all with the swearde,
{32:23} whose graues lye besyde him in the lowe pytte. His comos are buried rounde aboute his graue: alltogether wounded and slayne with the swearde, which men afore tyme brought feare in to ye londe off the lyuynge.
{32:24} There is Elam also with all his people, and their graues rounde aboute: which all beynge wounded and slayne with the swearde, are gone downe vncircumcised vnder the earth, which neuertheles somtyme brought feare in to the londe off the lyuynge: for the which they beare their shame, with the other that be gone downe to ye graue.
{32:25} Their buryall is geuen them and all their people, amonge them that be slayne. Their graues are rounde aboute all them, which be vncircumcised; and with them that be slay thorow the swearde: for seynge that in tymes past they made the londe off the lyuynge afrayed, they must now beare their owne shame, with them that go downe to the pytte, and lye amonge them, that be slayne.
{32:26} There is Mesech also and Tubal, and their people, and their graues rounde aboute. These all are amonge the vncircucised, and them that be slayne with the swearde, because afore tyme they made the londe off the lyuynge afrayed.
{32:27} Shulde not they then lye also amonge ye worthies, and vncircumcised Giauntes? which wt their weapens are gone downe to hel: whose sweardes are layed vnder their heades, whose wickednesse is vpon their bones: because that as worthies, they haue brought feare into ye lode of ye lyuinge;?
{32:28} Yee amoge the vncircucised shalt thou be destroyed, and slepe with them, that perished thorow the swearde.
{32:29} There is the lode off Edom with hir kynges and prynces also, which wt their stregth are layed by them that were slayne with the swearde, yee amonge the vncircumcised, and them which are gone downe in to the pytte.
{32:30} Morouer, there be all the prynces of the north, with all the Sidonias, which are gone downe to the slayne. With their feare and strength they are come to confucion, and lye there vncircumcised, amonge those that be slayne with the swearde: and beare their owne shame, with them that be gone downe to ye pytte.
{32:31} Now when Pharao seyth this, he shal be comforted ouer all his people, that is slayne with the swearde: both Pharao & all his hoost, saieth ye LORDE God.
{32:32} For I haue geue my feare in the lode of the lyunge. But Pharao & all his people shal lye amoge the vncircumcised, and amonge them that be slayne with the swearde, saieth the LORDE God.
{33:1} Agayne, the worde off the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{33:2} Thou sonne off man, Speake to the childre of thy people, and tell them: When I sende a swearde vpon a londe, yf the people off the londe take a man off their countre, and set him to be their watchman:
{33:3} ye same man (wha he seyth the swearde come vpon the londe) shall blowe the trompet, and warne the people.
{33:4} Yff a man now heare the noyse off the trompet & will not be warned, and the swearde come ad take him awaye: his bloude shall be vpo his owne heade:
{33:5} For he herde the soude of the trompet, and wolde not take hede, therfore his bloude be vpon him. But yff he will receaue warnynge, he shal saue his life.
{33:6} Agayne, yf the watch man se the swerde come, and shewe it not with the trompet, so yt the people is not warned: yff the swearde come then, and take eny man from amoge the: the same shall be taken awaye in his owne synne, but his bloude will I requyre off the watchmans honde.
{33:7} And now (O thou sonne of man) I haue made the a watchman vnto the house of Israel: that where as thou hearest eny thinge out of my mouth, thou mayest warne them on my behalfe.
{33:8} Yff I saye vnto the wicked: thou wicked, thou shalt surely dye: and thou geuest him not warnynge, that he maye bewarre off his vngodly waye: then shall the wicked dye in his owne synne, but his bloude will I requyre of thy honde.
{33:9} Neuertheles yf thou warne the wicked off his waye, to turne from it, where as he yet wil not be turned from it: then shal he dye because off his synne, but thou hast delyuered thy soule.
{33:10} Therfore (O thou sonne off man) speake vnto the house off Israel, Ye saye thus: Oure offences and synnes lye vpon vs, and we be corrupte in them: how shulde we then be restored vnto life?
{33:11} Tell them: As truly as I lyue (saieth the LORDE God) I haue no pleasure in the death off the wicked, but moch rather that the wicked turne from his waye and lyue. Turne you, turne you from yor vngodly wayes, o ye off the house off Israel. Oh, wherfore will ye dye?
{33:12} Thou sonne off man, tell the children off thy people: The rightuousnes of the rightuous shall not saue him, whan so euer he turneth awaye vnfaithfully: Agayne, the wickednesse of the wicked shal not hurte him, whan so euer he conuerteth from his vngodlynesse: And ye rightuousnesse of the rightuous shal not saue his life, when so euer he synneth.
{33:13} Yff I saye vnto the rightuous, that he shall surely lyue, and so he trust to his owne rightuousnesse, and do synne: then shall his rightuousnesse be nomore thought vpon, but in the wickednesse that he hath done, he shall dye.
{33:14} Agayne, yff I saye to the wicked: thou shalt surely dye: and so he turne fro his synnes, and do the thinge that is laufull and right:
{33:15} In so moch that the same wicked ma geueth the pledge agayne, restoreth that he had taken awaye by robbery, walketh in the comaundementes off life, and doth no wroge: Then shall he surely lyue, and not dye.
{33:16} Yee the synnes that he had done, shal neuer be thought vpon: For in so moch as he doth now the thynge that is laufull and right, he shall lyue.
{33:17} And yet the children off thy people saye: Tush, the waye of the LORDE is not right, where as their owne waye is rather vnright.
{33:18} When the rightuous turneth from his rightuousnesse, and doeth the thynge that is wicked, he shall dye therfore.
{33:19} But yf the wicked turne from his wickednesse, doinge the thinge that is laufull and right, he shall lyue therfore.
{33:20} Yet ye saye: the waye of ye LORDE is not equall. O ye house of Israel, I wil iudge euery one of you after his wayes.
{33:21} In the xij. yeare, the v. daye of the x. Moneth of oure captyuyte, it happened, that one which was fled out of Ierusalem, came vnto me, and sayde: ye cite is destroyed.
{33:22} Now the honde of the LORDE had bene vpon me the euenynge, afore this man (which was escaped) came vnto me, and had opened my mouth, vntyll the mornynge that he came to me: Yee he opened my mouth, so yt I was nomore domme.
{33:23} Then came the worde of ye LORDE vnto me, and sayde:
{33:24} Thou sonne off man, these that dwell in the waisted londe of Israel, saye: Abraham was but one man, ad he had the londe in possessio: now are we many, and the londe is geuen vs to possesse also
{33:25} And therfore tell them: Thus saieth the LORDE: In the bloude haue ye eaten, youre eyes haue ye lift vp to Idols, and haue shed bloude: shal ye then haue the londe in possession?
{33:26} Ye leane vpon youre sweardes, ye worke abhominacions, euery one defyleth his neghbours wife: and shal ye then possesse the londe?
{33:27} Saye thou these wordes vnto the: Thus saieth the LORDE God: As truly as I lyue, all ye that dwell in this wildernesse, shall be slayne wt the swearde: what so is vpon the felde, will I geue vnto the beestes to be deuoured: those that be in stronge holdes and dennes, shall dye off the pestilece.
{33:28} For I wil make the londe desolate and waist, and ye pope off hir strength shall come to an ende. The mountaynes in Israel shalbe so waiste that no man shall trauayle therby.
{33:29} Then shall they lerne to knowe, that I am the LORDE, whe I make the lode waist and desolate, because off all their abhominacions, that they haue wrought.
{33:30} And thou sonne off man, the children off thy people yt talke of the, by the walles ad in the dores of their houses, sayenge one to another: come, let vs heare, what worde is gone forth from the LORDE:
{33:31} These come vnto the, after ye maner of a greate people: yee my people syt downe before the, and heare thy wordes, but they do not therafter: For in their mouthes they shewe themselues, as though they were feruent, but their herte goeth after their owne couetous lucre.
{33:32} And as a balet yt hath a swete tune, ad is pleasaut to synge, so shalt thou be vnto them: thy wordes shal they heare, but they will not do therafter.
{33:33} Whe this commeth to passe (for lo, it cometh in dede) then shal they knowe, that there hath bene a prophet amonge them.
{34:1} And the worde off the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{34:2} Thou sonne off ma, prophecye agaynst the shepherdes of Israel, prophecy, and speake vnto them: Thus saieth the LORDE God: Wo be vnto the shepherdes off Israel, that fede them selues. Shulde not the shepherdes fede ye flockes?
{34:3} Ye haue eaten vp the fatte, ye haue clothed you with the woll: the best fedde haue ye slayne, but ye flocke haue ye not norished:
{34:4} The weake haue ye not holden vp, the sicke haue ye not healed: the broken haue ye not bounde together, the outcastes haue ye not brought agayne: ye lost haue ye not sought, but churlishly and cruelly haue ye ruled the.
{34:5} Thus are they scatred here and there without a shepherde: yee all the beastes off the felde deuoure them, and they go astraye.
{34:6} My shepe go wandringe vpon all moutaynes and vpon euery hye hill, yee they be scatred abrode in all feldes, and there is no man, that careth for them, or seketh after them.
{34:7} Therfore o ye shepherdes heare the worde off the LORDE,
{34:8} Thus sayeth the LORDE God: As truly as I lyue, for so moch as my shepe are robbed, and deuoured off all the wylde beestes off the felde, hauynge no shepherde: and seynge that my shepherdes take no regarde off my shepe, but fede them selues only, and not my shepe:
{34:9} Therfore heare ye worde off the LORDE, o ye shepherdes:
{34:10} Thus sayeth the LORDE God: Beholde, I myselff will vpon the shepherdes, and requyre my shepe from their hondes, and make the ceasse from fedynge of my shepe: yee the shepherdes shall fede them selues nomore: For I will delyuer my shepe out off their mouthes so that they shall not deuoure them after this.
{34:11} For thus saieth the LORDE God: Beholde, I will loke to my shepe myselff, and seke them.
{34:12} Like as a shepherde amoge the flocke seketh after the shepe that are scatred abrode, euen so will I seke after my shepe, and gather them together out off all places, where they haue bene scatred in the cloudy and darcke daye.
{34:13} I will bringe them out from all people, and gather them together out of all londes. I will bringe the in to their owne londe, and fede them vpon the mountaynes off Israel, by the ryuers, and in all the places of the countre.
{34:14} I will fede them in right good pastures, and vpon the hie mountaynes off Israel shall there foldes be. There shal they lye in a good folde, ad in a fat pasture shall they fede: euen vpon the mountaynes of Israel.
{34:15} I will fede my shepe myselff, and bringe them to their rest, sayeth the LORDE God.
{34:16} Soch as be lost, will I seke: soch as go astraye, wil I brynge agayne: soch as be wouded, will I bynde vp: soch as be weake, will I make stronge: soch as be fat and well lykinge, those will I preserue, and fede them with ye thinge that is laufull.
{34:17} And as for you (o my shepe) sayeth the LORDE God: I will put a difference amonge the shepe, amonge the wethers ad the goates.
{34:18} Was it not ynough for you, to eat vp the good pasture, but ye must treade downe the residue of youre pasture wt youre fete also? Was it not ynough for you to drynke cleare water, but ye must trouble the residue also with youre fete?
{34:19} Thus my shepe must be fayne to eate ye thinge, that ye haue troden downe with yor fete, and to drynke it, that ye with youre fete haue defyled.
{34:20} Therfore, thus sayeth the LORDE God vnto them: Beholde, I will seuer the fat shepe from the leane:
{34:21} for so moch as ye haue shot the weake shepe a po ye sydes & shulders, and runne vpon them with youre hornes, so longe till ye haue vtterly scatred them abrode.
{34:22} I wil helpe my shepe, so yt they shal nomore be spoyled: yee I wil discerne one shepe from another.
{34:23} I wil rayse vp vnto them one only shepherde: euen my seruaunt Dauid, he shal fede the, and he shal be their shepherde.
{34:24} I the LORDE wil be their God, and my seruaunt Dauid shal be their prince: Euen I the LORDE haue spoken it.
{34:25} Morouer, I wil make a couenaunt of peace with them, and dryue all euell beastes out of the londe: so that they maye dwell safely in the wildernesse, and slepe in the woddes.
{34:26} Good fortune & prosperite wil I geue them, and vnto all that be rounde aboute my hill. A prosperous shower and rayne wil I sende them in due season,
{34:27} that the trees in the wodde maye bringe forth their frutes, & ye grounde hir increase. They shalbe safe in their londe, and shal knowe, that I am the LORDE, which haue broke their yocke, and delyuered them out of the hondes of those, that helde them in subieccion.
{34:28} They shal nomore be spoyled of the Heithen, ner deuoured with the beastes of the lode: but safely shal they dwell, & no man shall fraye them.
{34:29} I wil set vp an excellet plate for them, so yt they shal suffre no more hunger in the londe, nether beare the reprofe of ye Heithen eny more.
{34:30} Thus shal they vnderstonde, that I the LORDE their God am wt them, & yt they (euen the house of Israel) are my people, saieth the LORDE God.
{34:31} Ye men are my flocke, ye are the shepe of my pasture: and I am youre God, saieth the LORDE God.
{35:1} Morouer, the worde of the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{35:2} Thou sonne of man, turne thy face towarde the mount Seir, prophecy vpon it,
{35:3} & saye vnto it: Thus saieth the LORDE God: Beholde, (o thou mount Seir) I will vpon the, I will reach out myne hode ouer the, yee waist & desolate wil I make the.
{35:4} Thy cities wil I breake downe, & thou shalt lye voyde: that thou mayest knowe, how that I am the LORDE.
{35:5} For so moch as thou bearest an olde enemyte agaynst the children of Israel, & with a cruel honde hast made them afrayed, what tyme as they were troubled & punyshed for their synne:
{35:6} Therfore, as truly as I lyue (saieth ye LORDE God) I wil prepare the vnto bloude, yee bloude shal folowe vpon the: seinge thou layest waite for bloude, therfore shall bloude persecute the.
{35:7} Thus wil I make the mount Seir desolate & waist, and bringe to passe, that there shall no man go thither, ner come from thence.
{35:8} His mountaynes wil I fyll wt his slayne men: thy hilles, dales and valleys shal lye full of them, that are slayne with ye swearde.
{35:9} I wil make the a perpetuall wildernesse, so that noman shal dwell in thy cities: yt ye maye knowe, how yt I am the LORDE.
{35:10} And because thou hast sayde: what, both these nacions and both these londes must be myne, & I wil haue them in possession, where as the LORDE was there. Therfore, thus saieth the LORDE God:
{35:11} As truly as I lyue, I will hadle the acordinge to thy wrath and gelousy, like as thou hast dealt cruelly with them: that I maye be knowne amoge them, how I haue punyshed the
{35:12} Yee and that thou also mayest be sure, that I the LORDE haue herde all thy despyteful wordes, which thou hast spoke agaynst the mountaynes of Israel, sayenge: Lo, they are made waist, and geuen vs to deuoure.
{35:13} Thus with youre mouthes ye haue made youre boost agaynst me, yee & multiplied youre proude wordes agaynst me, which I haue herde altogether.
{35:14} Where vnto, thus saieth ye LORDE God: when the whole worlde is in wealth, then wil I make the waist.
{35:15} And like as thou (o mount Seir) wast glad, because the heretage of the house of Israel was destroyed: euen so wil I do vnto the also, that thou and whole Edom shall be destroyed, & knowe, that I am the LORDE.
{36:1} Thou sonne of man, prophecie vpon the mountaynes of Israel, & speake: Heare the worde of the LORDE, o ye mountaynes of Israel:
{36:2} Thus saieth the LORDE God: Because yor enemie hath sayde vpon you: A ha, ye hie euerlastynge places are now become ours:
{36:3} prophecy therfore, & speake: thus saieth ye LORDE God: Seinge ye be waisted & trode downe on euery syde, & become a possession vnto ye resydue of ye Getiles, which haue brought you in to mes mouthes & vnto an euel name amonge ye people:
{36:4} Therfore, heare the worde of the LORDE God, o ye mountaynes of Israel: Thus saieth the LORDE God vnto the mountaynes and hilles, valleys & dales, to the voyde wildernesses & desolate cities, which are spoyled, and had in derision on euery syde, amonge the resydue of the Heithe:
{36:5} Yee eue thus saieth the LORDE God: In the fyre of my gelousy haue I taken a deuyce, agaynst the resydue of the Getiles, and agaynst all Edom: which haue take in my lode vnto theselues for a possession: which also reioysed fro their whole herte wt a despiteful stomacke, to waist it, and to spoyle it.
{36:6} Prophecy therfore vpon the londe of Israel, speake vnto ye mountaynes and hilles, to valleys and dales, thus saieth the LORDE God: Beholde, this haue I deuysed in my gelousy and terrible wrath: For so moch as ye haue suffred reprofe of the Heithen,
{36:7} therfore thus saieth the LORDE God: I haue sworne, that the Gentiles which lye aboute you, shal beare youre confucion them selues.
{36:8} And as for you (o mountaynes of Israel) ye shall shute out youre braunches, and bringe forth youre frute to my people of Israel, for it is harde by, that it wil come.
{36:9} Beholde, I come vnto you, and vnto you will I turne me, that ye maye be tylled and sowen.
{36:10} I wil sende you moch people, which shalbe all of the house of Israel: the cities shalbe inhabited, and ye decayed places shalbe repayred againe.
{36:11} I wil prouyde you with moch people and catell, which shal increase & bringe frute. I wil restore you also to youre olde estate, and shewe you more kindnes the euer ye had before: wherby ye shal knowe, yt I am the LORDE.
{36:12} Yee people wil I sende vnto you (o my folke of Israel (which shal haue the in possession, and thou shalt be their inheritaunce, so that thou shalt nomore be without them.
{36:13} Agayne, thus saieth the LORDE God: For so moch as they saye vnto you: thou art an eater vp of men, and a waister of thy people:
{36:14} therfore thou shalt eate no mo men, nether destroye thy people eny more, saieth the LORDE God.
{36:15} And I wil not suffre the, for to heare thine owne confucion amonge the Gentiles from hensforth. Thou shalt not beare the reprofe of the nacions, ner cast out thine owne people enymore, saieth the LORDE God.
{36:16} Morouer, the worde of the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{36:17} O thou sonne of ma, when the house of Israel dwelt vpon their owne grounde, they defyled them selues with their owne wayes & ymaginacions: so that in my sight their waye was like the vnclennesse of a menstruous woman.
{36:18} Wherfore I poured my wrothfull displeasure vpon them, because of the bloude that they had shed in the londe, & because of their Idols, wherwith they had defyled them selues.
{36:19} I scatred them also amonge the Heithen, so that they were strowed aboute in the lodes. Acordinge to their wayes & after their owne inuencions, so dyd I punysh them.
{36:20} Now when they were gone vnto the Heithen, and come in amonge them, they dishonoured my holy name: so that it was sayde of them: Are these the people of God, & must go out of their owne londe?
{36:21} Then spared I my holy name, which ye house of Israel had dishonoured amonge the Gentiles, to whom they came.
{36:22} Therfore tell ye house of Israel: Thus saieth the LORDE God: I do not this for yor sakes (O house of Israel) but for my holy names sake, which ye dishonoured amoge the Heithen, when ye came to them.
{36:23} Therfore, I wil halowe my greate name agayne, which amonge the Getiles is euel spoken of: for ye youre selues haue dishououred it amoge them. And the Gentiles shal knowe, that I am the LORDE, when I am honoured in you before their eyes, saieth ye LORDE God.
{36:24} As for you, I wil take you from amonge the Heithen, and gather you together out of all countrees, and bringe you agayne in to youre owne londe.
{36:25} Then will I poure cleare water vpon you, & ye shalbe clene: Yee from all youre vnclennesse and from all yor Idols shal I clense you.
{36:26} A new herte also wil I geue you, and a new sprete wil I put in to you: As for that stony hert, I will take it out of youre body, and geue you a flesshy herte.
{36:27} I wil geue you my sprete amonge you, and cause you to walke in my commaundemetes, to kepe my lawes, and to fulfill them.
{36:28} And so ye shall dwell in the londe, that I gaue to yor forefathers, & ye shal be my people, and I wil be youre God.
{36:29} I wil helpe you out of all youre vnclenesse, I wil call for the corne, and wil increase it, and wil let you haue no honger.
{36:30} I will multiplie the frutes of the trees and ye increase of the felde for you, so that ye shal beare no more reprofe of honger amoge the Heithe.
{36:31} Then shal ye remebre yor owne wicked wayes, and youre ymaginacios, which were not good: so that ye shal take displeasure at youre owne selues, by reason of youre synnes and abhominacions.
{36:32} But I wil not do this for youre sakes (saieth the LORDE God) be ye sure of it. Therfore (o ye house of Israel) be ashamed of youre synnes.
{36:33} Morouer, thus saieth the LORDE God: what tyme as I shal clese you from all youre offences, then wil I make the cities to be occupied agayne, and wil repayre the places that be decayed.
{36:34} The desolate londe shalbe buylded agayne, which afore tyme laye waist, in the sight of all them, that wete by.
{36:35} Then shal it be sayde: This waist lode is become like a garden of pleasure, and the voyde, desolate and broke downe cities, are now stronge, and fensed agayne.
{36:36} Then the residue of the Heithen that lye rounde aboute you, shal knowe, that I am the LORDE, which repayre that was broken downe, and plante agayne, that was made waist. Euen I the LORDE haue spoken it, & wil do it in dede.
{36:37} Thus saieth the LORDE God: I wil yet once be founde agayne of ye house of Israel, & do this for them: I shal increase them as a flocke of men.
{36:38} Like as the holy flocke and the flocke of Ierusalem are in the hie solempne feastes: so shal also the wilde waisted cities be fylled with flockes of men: and they shal knowe, that I am the LORDE.
{37:1} The honde of the LORDE came vpon me, & caried me out in the sprete of the LORDE, & let me downe in a playne felde, that laye full of bones,
{37:2} & he led me rounde aboute by them: & beholde, the bones that laye vpon the felde, were very many, & maruelous drye also.
{37:3} Then sayde he vnto me: Thou sonne of man: thinkest thou these bones maye lyue agayne? I answered: O LORDE God, thou knowest.
{37:4} And he sayde vnto me: Prophecy thou vpon these bones, & speake vnto them: Ye drye bones, heare the worde of the LORDE.
{37:5} Thus saieth the LORDE God vnto these bones: Beholde, I will put breth in to you, that ye maye lyue:
{37:6} I wil geue you synowes, & make flesh growe vpon you, & couer you ouer with skynne: & so geue you breth, that ye maye lyue, and knowe, that I am the LORDE.
{37:7} So I prophecied, as he had comaunded me. And as I was prophecienge, there came a noyse and a greate mocion, so that the bones ranne euery one to another.
{37:8} Now whe I had loked, beholde, they had synowes, and flesh grewe vpon them: and aboue they were couered with skynne, but there was no breth in them.
{37:9} Then sayde he vnto me: Thou sonne of man, prophecie thou towarde the wynde: prophecy, and speake to the wynde: Thus saieth the LORDE God: Come (o thou ayre) from the foure wyndes, & blowe vpon these slayne, that they maye be restored to life.
{37:10} So I prophecied, as he had commaunded me: Then came the breth tnto them, and they receaued life, and stode vp vpon their fete, a maruelous greate sorte.
{37:11} Morouer, he sayde vnto me: Thou sonne of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Beholde, they saye: oure bones are dryed vp, oure hope is gone, we are clene cut of.
{37:12} Therfore prophecie thou, & speake vnto them. Thus saieth the LORDE God: Beholde, I wil open youre graues (o my people) & take you out of youre sepulcres, & bringe you in to the londe of Israel agayne.
{37:13} So shall ye knowe yt I am the LORDE, when I open youre graues, & bringe you out of them.
{37:14} My sprete also wil I put in you, & ye shal lyue: I wil set you agayne in youre owne londe, and ye shal knowe, that I am the LORDE, which haue sayde it, and fulfilled it in dede.
{37:15} The worde of the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{37:16} Thou sonne of man, take a sticke and wryte vpon it: Vnto Iuda & to the children of Israel his companyons. Then take another sticke, and wryte vpon it: Vnto Ioseph the stocke of Ephraim, and to all the housholde of Israel his companyons.
{37:17} And than take both these together in thine honde, so shal there be one stycke therof.
{37:18} Now yf the childre of thy people saye vnto the: wilt thou not shewe vs, what thou meanest by these?
{37:19} Then geue them this answere: Thus saieth the LORDE God: Beholde, I wil take the stocke of Ioseph, which is in the honde of Ephraim and of the trybes of Israel his felowes, and wil put them to the stocke of Iuda, & make them one stocke, and they shalbe one in my honde.
{37:20} And the two stickes where vpon thou wrytest, shalt thou haue in thine honde, that they maye se,
{37:21} and shalt saye vnto them: Thus saieth the LORDE God: beholde I wil take awaye the childre of Israel from amonge the Heithen, vnto whom they be gone, and wil gather them together on euery syde, and bringe them agayne in to their owne londe:
{37:22} yee I wil make one people of the in ye londe, vpon the mountaynes of Israel, and they all shal haue but one kinge. They shall nomore be two peoples from hensforth, nether be deuyded in to two kingdomes:
{37:23} they shal also defyle the selues nomore with their abhominacions, Idols and all their wickeddoinges. I wil helpe the out of all their dwellinge places, wherin they haue synned: & will so clense them, that they shalbe my people, and I their God.
{37:24} Dauid my seruaunt shalbe their kinge, & they all shal haue one shepherde only. They shal walke in my lawes, and my commaundementes shalt they both kepe & fulfill.
{37:25} They shal dwell in the londe, that I gaue vnto Iacob my seruaunt, where as youre fathers also haue dwelt. Yee eue in the same londe shal they, their children, & their childers children dwell for euermore: and my seruaunt Dauid shal be their euerlastynge prynce.
{37:26} Morouer, I will make a bonde of peace with them, which shal be vnto them an euerlastinge couenaunt. I wil sattle the also, and multiplie them, my Sanctuary wil I set amonge the for euermore.
{37:27} My dwellinge shalbe wt them, yee I wil be their God, & they shalbe my people.
{37:28} Thus the Heithen also shal knowe, that I the LORDE am ye holy maker of Israel: whe my Sanctuary shal be amonge them for euer more.
{38:1} And the worde of the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:
{38:2} Thou sonne of man, turne thy face towarde Gog in the londe of Magog, which is the chefe prynce at Mesech and Tubal: prophecy agaynst him,
{38:3} and saye: Thus saieth the LORDE God: O Gog thou chefe prynce of Mesech and Tubal: beholde, I wil vpon the,
{38:4} and wil turne the aboute, and put a bytt in thy chawes: I wil bringe the forth and all thine hoost, both horse & horsmen, which be all weapened of the best fashion: a greate people, that handle altogether speares, shyldes, and swerdes:
{38:5} the Perses, Moryans and with them the Lybians, which all beare shyldes and helmettes:
{38:6} Gomer, and all his hoostes: the house of Thogorma out of the north quarters, and all his hoostes, yee and moch people with the.
{38:7} Therfore prepare the, set thy self in araye with all thy people, that are come vnto the by heapes, and be thou their defence.
{38:8} After many dayes thou shalt be visited, and in the latter yeares thou shalt come in to the lode, that hath bene destroyed with the swearde, & now is replenished agayne wt dyuerse people vpon the mountaynes of Israel, which haue loge lyen waist. Yee they be brought out of the nacions, & dwell all safe.
{38:9} Thou shalt come vp like a stormy wether, to couer the lode, and as it were a darcke cloude: thou with all thine hoostes, and a greate multitude of people with the.
{38:10} Morouer, thus saieth the LORDE God: At the same tyme shal many thinges come in to thy mynde, so that thou shalt ymagyn myschefe,
{38:11} and saye: I wil vp to yonder playne londe, seinge they syt at ease, and dwell so safely (for they dwell all without eny walles, they haue nether barres nor dores)
{38:12} to spoyle them, to robbe the, to laye honde vpon their so wel inhabited wildernesses: agaynst that people, yt is gathered together from amonge the Heithe, which haue gotten catell and good, and dwell in the myddest of the londe.
{38:13} Then shal Saba and Dedan and the marchauntes of Tharsis wt all their Worthies, saye vnto the: Art thou come to robbe? Hast thou gathered thy people together, because thou wilt spoyle? to take syluer and golde: to cary awaye catell and good: and to haue a greate pray?
{38:14} Therfore, o thou sonne of man, thou shalt prophecie, and saye vnto Gog: Thus saieth the LORDE God: In that daye thou shalt knowe, that my people of Israel dwelleth safe:
{38:15} and shalt come from thy place, out of the north partes: thou and moch people wt the, which ryde vpon horses, wherof there is a greate multitude and an innumerable sorte.
{38:16} Yee thou shalt come vpon my people of Israel, as a cloude to couer the lode. This shal come to passe in the latter dayes: I wil bringe the vp in to my londe, that the Heithen maye knowe me, when I get me honoure vpon the (o Gog) before their eyes.
{38:17} Thus saieth the LORDE God: Thou art he, of whom I haue spoken aforetyme, by my seruauntes ye prophetes of Israel, which prophecied in those dayes & yeares, that I shulde bringe the vpon them.
{38:18} At the same tyme, when Gog commeth vp in to the londe of Israel (saieth the LORDE God) shal my indignacio go forth in my wrath.
{38:19} For in my gelousy and hote displeasure I haue deuysed, that there shalbe a greate trouble in the londe of Israel at that tyme.
{38:20} The very fysshes in the see, the foules of the ayre, the beestes of the felde, and all the men yt are vpon the earth, shal tremble for feare of me. The hilles also shalbe turned vpsidedowne, the stayres of stone shal fall, and all walles shal syncke to the grounde.
{38:21} I wil call for a swearde vpon them in all my mountaynes, saieth the LORDE God: so that euery mans swearde shal be vpon another.
{38:22} With pestilece and bloude wil I punysh him: stormy rayne and hale stones, fyre and brymstone, wil I cause to rayne vpon him and all his heape, yee and vpon all that greate people that is with him.
{38:23} Thus wil I be magnified, honoured, and knowne amonge the Heithen: that they maye be sure, how yt I am ye LORDE.
{39:1} Therfore o thou sonne of man, prophecie agaynst Gog, and speake: Thus saieth the LORDE God: Beholde, o Gog: thou chefe prynce at Mesech and Tubal, I wil vpon the,
{39:2} and turne the aboute, & carie the forth, & lede ye from the north partes, and bringe the vp to the mountaynes of Israel
{39:3} As for thy bowe, I wil smyte it out of thy left honde, and cast thine arowes out of thy right honde.
{39:4} Thou with all thine heape, and all the people that is with the, must fall vpon the mountaynes of Israel. Then wil I geue the vnto ye foules and wilde beastes of the felde, to be deuoured:
{39:5} there must thou lye vpon the felde: for eue I the LORDE haue spoken it, saieth the LORDE God.
{39:6} In to Magog, and amonge those that sit so carelesse in the Iles: wil I sende a fyre, and they shal knowe, yt I am the LORDE.
{39:7} I wil make also the name of my holynesse to be knowne amonge my people of Israel: and I will not let my holy name be euel spoken of enymore: but the very Heithen also shal knowe, that I am the LORDE, the holy one of Israel.
{39:8} Beholde, it commeth, and shalbe fulfilled in dede, saieth the LORDE God. This is the daye, wherof I haue spoken:
{39:9} They that dwell in ye cities of Israel, shal go forth and set fyre vpon the weapens, and burne them: shyldes and speres, bowes and arowes, bylles and clubbes: seuen yeares
{39:10} shall they be burnynge therof, so that they shall els bringe no stickes from ye felde, nether haue nede to hew downe eny out of the wodde: For they shall haue weapens ynew to burne. They shal robbe those that robbed them, and spoyle those that spoyled them, saieth ye LORDE God.
{39:11} At the same tyme will I geue vnto Gog, a place to be buried in, in Israel: eue the valley, where thorow men go from the east to the see warde. Those that trauayle therby, shal abhorre it. There shal Gog and all his people be buried: and it shalbe called the valley of the people of Gog.
{39:12} Seuen monethes longe shall the house of Israel be burienge of them, that they maye clense the lode:
{39:13} Yee all the people of the londe shal burie them. O it shal be a glorious daye, when I get me that honoure, saieth the LORDE God.
{39:14} They shal ordene men also to be deedburiers, euer goinge thorow the lode, and appoynte them certayne places to bury those in, which remayne vpon the felde, that the londe maye be clensed. From ende to ende shal they seke, and that vij monethes loge.
{39:15} Now those that go thorow the londe, where they se a mans bone, they shall set vp a token by it, till the deedburiers haue buried it also, in the valley of the people of Gog.
{39:16} And the name of the cite shalbe called Hamona: Thus shall they make the londe clene.
{39:17} And thou sonne of man: thus saieth the LORDE God: Speake vnto all the foules and euery byrde, yee and to all the wilde beastes of the felde: heape you together and come, gather you roude aboute vpo my slaughter, that I haue slayne for you: euen a greate slaughter vpon the mountaynes of Israel: eate flesh, and drynke bloude.
{39:18} Ye shal eate ye flesh of the worthies, and drynke the bloude of the prynces of the londe: of the wethers, of the lambes, of the goates, and of the oxen that be all slayne at Basan.
{39:19} Eate ye fat youre bely full, and drynke bloude, till ye be droncken of the slaughter, which I haue slayne vnto you.
{39:20} Fyl you at my table, with horses & stronge horsmen: with captaynes and all me of warre, saieth the LORDE God.
{39:21} I will bringe my glory also amonge the Gentiles, that all the Heithen maye se my iudgment, that I haue kepte, and my honde which I haue layed vpon them:
{39:22} that ye house of Israel maye knowe, how that I am ye LORDE their God, from that daye forth.
{39:23} And the Heithen shal knowe, that where as the house of Israel were led into captiuyte: it was for their wickednes sake, because they offended me. For the which cause I hyd my face from them, and delyuered them in to the hondes of their enemies, that they might all be slayne with the swearde.
{39:24} Acordinge to their vnclennesse and vnfaithfull dealinges, so haue I entreated them, and hyd my face from them.
{39:25} Therfore thus saieth ye LORDE God: Now will I bringe agayne the captyues of Iacob, and haue mercy vpon the whole house of Israel, and be gelous for my holy names sake.
{39:26} All their confucion and offence that they haue done agaynst me, shal be taken awaye: and so safely shal they dwell in their londe, that no man shal make them afrayed.
{39:27} And when I haue brought the agayne from amonge the people, when I haue gathered them together out of their enemies londes, and am praysed in them before many Heithen:
{39:28} then shall they knowe, that I am the LORDE their God, which suffred them to be led in to captiuyte amonge the Heithen, but now haue brought them agayne in to their owne londe, and not left one of them yonder.
{39:29} After that, will I hyde my face nomore from them, but will poure out my sprete vpon the house of Israel, saieth the LORDE God.
{40:1} In the xxv yeare of oure captiuyte, in the begynnynge of the yeare, the x daye of the moneth: that is the xiiij yeare, after that ye cite was smytten downe: the same daye came the honde of the LORDE vpon me, and caried me forth:
{40:2} euen into the londe of Israel brought he me in the visions of God: and set me downe vpo a maruelous hie mountayne, whervpon there was a buyldinge (as it had bene of a cite) towarde the north.
{40:3} Thither he caried me, and beholde, there was a man, whose similitude was like brasse, which had a threde of flax in his honde, and a meterodde also. He stode in the dore,
{40:4} & sayde vnto me: marcke well with thine eyes, herken to with thine eares, and fasten it in thine hert, what so euer I shal shewe the, for to the intent that they might be shewed the, therfore art thou brought hither. And what soeuer thou seyst, thou shalt certifie the house of Israel therof.
{40:5} Beholde, there was a wall on the outsyde rounde aboute the house: the meterodde that he had in his honde, was six cubites longe & a spanne. So he measured the bredth of the buyldinge, which was a meterodde, and the heyth also a meterodde.
{40:6} Then came he vnto the eastdore, and wente vp the stares, & measured the postes of the dore: wherof euery one was a meterodde thicke. Euery chambre was a meterodde longe and brode:
{40:7} betwene the chambers were fyue cubites. The poste of the dore within the porche, was one meterodde.
{40:8} He measured also the porche of the ynnermer dore, which conteyned a meterodde.
{40:9} The measured he the entrie of the dore, that conteyned eght cubites, and his pilers two cubites: and this entrie stode inwarde.
{40:10} The chambers of the dore eastwarde, were thre on euery syde: alike brode and longe. The pilers also that stode of both the sydes, were of one measure.
{40:11} After this, he measured the wydenesse of the dore: which was x cubites, & the heyth of the dore xiij cubites.
{40:12} The edge before the chabres was one cubite brode vpo both the sydes, & the chambres six cubites wyde of either syde.
{40:13} He measured ye dore from the rygge of one chabre to another, whose wydenesse was xxv cubites, & one dore stode agaynst another.
{40:14} He made pilers also lx cubites hie, rounde aboute the courte dore.
{40:15} Before the inwarde parte vnto the fore entre of the ynnermer dore, were fiftie cubites.
{40:16} The chambers and their pilers within, rounde aboute vnto ye dore, had syde wyndowes: So had the fore entries also, whose wyndowes wente rounde aboute within. And vpon the pilers there stode date trees.
{40:17} Then brought he me in to the fore courte, where as were chabres & paued workes, made in ye fore courte roude aboute: xxx chabres vpon one paued worcke.
{40:18} Now the paued worke was a loge besyde the dores, and that was the lower paued worke.
{40:19} After this, he measured ye bredth from the lower dore, vnto the ynnermer courte of the outsyde, which had an hundreth cubites vpon the east & the north parte.
{40:20} And the dore in the vttemost courte towarde the north, measured he after the legth and bredth:
{40:21} his thre chambres also on either syde, with his pilers & fore entries: which had euen the measure of the first dore. His heyth was fiftie cubites, the bredth xxv cubites:
{40:22} his wyndowes & porches with his datetrees, had euen like measure as the dore towarde the east: there where vij steppes to go vp vpo, & their porche before them.
{40:23} Now ye dore of the ynnermer courte stode straight ouer agaynst the dore, that was towarde ye north east. From one dore to another, he measured an C cubites.
{40:24} After that, he brought me to the south syde, where there stode a dore towarde ye south: whose pilers and porches he measured, these had the fyrst measure,
{40:25} & with their porches they had wyndowes rounde aboute, like the first wyndowes. The heyth was l cubites, ye bredth xxv,
{40:26} with steppes to go vp vpon: his porche stode before him, with his pilers and datetrees on either syde.
{40:27} And the dore of the ynnermer courte stode towarde the south, & he measured from one dore to another an C cubites.
{40:28} So he brought me in to ye ynnermer courte, thorow the dore of the south syde: which he measured, & it had the measure afore sayde.
{40:29} In like maner, his chambres, pilers and fore entries, had euen the fore sayde measure also. And he had with his porches rounde aboute, wyndowes of l cubites hye, & xxv cubites brode.
{40:30} The porches rounde aboute were xxv cubites longe, and v cubites brode:
{40:31} and his porch reached vnto ye vttemost courte: vpon his pilers there were date trees, and viij steppes to go vp vpon.
{40:32} He brought me also in to the ynmost courte vpon the east syde, and measured the dore, acordinge to ye measure afore sayde.
{40:33} His chabers, pilers and porches had euen the same measure, as the first had: & with his porches he had wyndowes roude aboute. The heith was l cubites, ye bredth xxv cubites:
{40:34} His porches reached vnto the vttemost courte: his pilers also had date trees on either syde, and viij steppes to go vp vpon.
{40:35} And he brought me to the north dore, and measured it, which also had the foresayde measure.
{40:36} His chabres, pilers and porches had wyndowes rounde aboute: whose heyth was l cubites, and the bredth xxv.
{40:37} His pilers stode towarde the vttemost courte, and vpon them both were date trees, and viij steppes to go vp vpon.
{40:38} There stode a chambre also, whose intrauce was at the dore pilers, and there the burntoffringes were wasshed.
{40:39} In the dore porche, there stode on ether syde two tables for the slaughtinge: to slaye the brentoffringes, synneoffringes and trespaceoffringes thervpon.
{40:40} And on the out syde as men go forth to the north dore, there stode two tables.
{40:41} Foure stables stode on ether syde of the dore, that is viij tables, whervpon they slaughted.
{40:42} Foure tables were of hewen stone for the burntoffringes, of a cubite and a half longe and brode, and one cubite hie: whervpon were layed ye vessels and ornamentes, which were vsed to, the burnt & slayne offeringes, when they were slaughted.
{40:43} And within there were hokes foure fyngers brode, fastened rounde aboute, to hange flesh vpon, & vpon the tables was layed the offringe flesh.
{40:44} On the outsyde of the ynnermer dore were the syngers chambers in the inwarde courte besyde ye north dore ouer agaynst the south. There stode one also, besyde the east dore north warde.
{40:45} And he sayde vnto me: This chambre on the south syde belongeth to the prestes, that kepe the habitacion:
{40:46} and this towarde the north, is the prestes that wayte vpon the aulter: which be the sonnes of Sadoch, that do seruyce before the LORDE in steade of the children of Leui.
{40:47} So he measured the fore courte, which had in length an C cubites, and as moch in bredth by the foure corners. Now the aulter stode before the house:
{40:48} And he brought me to the fore entre of the house, and measured the walles by the entre dore: which were fyue cubites longe on ether syde. The thicknesse also of the dore on ether syde, was thre cubites.
{40:49} The legth of the porche was xx cubites. the bredth xj. cubites, and vpon steppes went men vp to it: by the walles also were pilers, on either syde one.
{41:1} After this he brought me to the temple, and measured the postes: which were of both the sydes vj. cubites thicke, acordinge to the wydenesse of the tabernacle.
{41:2} The bredth of ye dore was x. cubites, & the walles of the dore on either syde fyue cubites. He measured the length therof, which conteyned xl. cubites, and the bredth xx.
{41:3} The wente he in, and measured the dore postes, which were two cubites thicke: but the dore itself was sixe cubites, and the bredth of the dore was vij. cubites.
{41:4} He measured the legth and bredth therof, which were euery one xx. cubites, before the temple. And he sayde vnto me: this is the holyest of all.
{41:5} He measured also the wall of the house, which was sixe cubites. The chambres yt stode rounde aboute ye house, were euery one foure cubites wyde,
{41:6} and one stode harde vpo another, wherof there were xxxiij. And there stode postes beneth by the walles rounde aboute the house, to beare the vp: but in ye wall of ye house they were not fastened:
{41:7} The syde chambres were the hyer the wyder, and had steppes thorow them rounde aboute ye house. Thus was it wyder aboue, that from the lowest men might go to the hyest & mydde chabers.
{41:8} I sawe also that the house was very hye rounde aboute. The foundacion of the syde chambres was a meterodde (that is sixe cubites) brode.
{41:9} The thicknesse of the syde wall without, conteyned fyue cubites, & so dyd ye outwall of the chabers in ye house.
{41:10} Betwene the chambers, was the wydenes xx. cubites rounde aboute ye house.
{41:11} The chambre dores stode ouer agaynst the outwall, the one dore was towarde the north, ye other towarde the south: and the thicknesse of the outwall was v cubites rounde aboute.
{41:12} Now the buyldinge that was separated towarde the west, was lxx. cubites wyde: the wall of the buyldinge was v cubites thicke roude aboute, and the length foure score cubites and ten.
{41:13} So he measured the house which was an C. cubites longe, and the separated buyldinge with the wall were an C. cubites loge also.
{41:14} The wydnesse before the house and of it yt was separated towarde the east, was an C. cubites.
{41:15} And he measured the length of the buyldinge before and behinde with the chabers vpon both the sydes: and it conteyned an C. cubites. The ynnermer temple, the porch of the forecourte,
{41:16} ye syde postes, these thre had syde wyndowes, and pilers rounde aboute ouer agaynst the postes, from the grounde vp to the wyndowes: The wyndowes them selues were syled ouer with bordes:
{41:17} & thus was it aboue the dore, vnto the ynmost house, and without also: Yee the whole wall on euery syde both within and without was syled ouer wt greate bordes.
{41:18} There were Cherubins and date trees made also, so that one date tre stode euer betwixte two Cherubins: One Cherub had two faces,
{41:19} ye face of a man lokinge asyde towarde the date tre, and a lyons face on the other syde. Thus was it made roude aboute in all the house:
{41:20} Yee the Cherubins and date trees were made from the grounde vp aboue the dore, and so stode they also vpon the wall of the temple.
{41:21} The bypostes of the temple were foure squared, and the fashion of the Sanctuary was, euen as it appeared vnto me afore in ye vision.
{41:22} The table was of wodde, thre cubites hie and two cubites longe: his corners, the length and the walles were of wodde. And he sayde vnto me: This is the table, that shal stonde before the LORDE.
{41:23} The temple and the holiest of all had ether of them two dores,
{41:24} and euery dore had two litle wickettes which were folden in one vpon another, on euery syde two.
{41:25} And vpon the dores of the temple there were made Cherubins and date trees, like as vpon the walles: and a greate thicke balke of wodde was before on the outsyde of the porche.
{41:26} Vpo both the sydes of the walles of the porche, there were made depe wyndowes and date trees, hauynge beames and balkes, like as the house had.
{42:1} Then caried he me out in to the fore courte towarde the north, & brought me in to the chambre that stode ouer agaynst the backebuyldinge northwarde, which had the length of an C.
{42:2} cubites, whose dore turned towarde the north. The wydenesse conteyned L. cubites,
{42:3} ouer agaynst the xx. cubites of the ynnermer courte, & agaynst the paued worke that was in the fore courte. Besyde all these thre there stode pilers, one ouer against another:
{42:4} And before this chabre there was a walkinge place of x. cubites wyde, and within was a waye of one cubite wyde, and their dores towarde the north.
{42:5} Thus the hyest chambres were allwaye narower then the lowest and myddelmost of ye buildinge:
{42:6} for they bare chambre vpon chambre, and stode thre together one vpon another, not hauynge pilers like the fore courte: therfore were they smaller then those beneth and in the myddest, to reken from the grounde vpwarde.
{42:7} The wall without that stode by ye chambres towarde the vttemost courte vpon the fore syde of the chambres, was L. cubites loge:
{42:8} for the legth of ye vttemost chambers in the fore courte was L. cubites also: but the length therof before the temple was an C. cubites.
{42:9} These chambres had vnder them an intraunce of the east syde, wherby a man might go into them out of the fore courte,
{42:10} thorow the thicke wall of the fore courte towarde the east, right ouer agaynst the separated buyldinge.
{42:11} Before the same buyldinge vpo this syde there were chabers also which, had a waye vnto them, like as the chambers on the north syde of the same length and wydenesse. Their intraunce, fashion and dores were all of the same maner.
{42:12} Yee euen like as the other chamber dores were, so were those also of the south syde. And before the waye towarde the syngers steppes on the east syde, there stode a dore to go in at.
{42:13} Then sayde he vnto me: The chambers towarde the north & the south, which stode before the backe buyldinge: those be holy habitacions, wherin the prestes that do seruyce before the LORDE, must eate the most holy offringes: and there must they laye the most holy offringes: meatoffringes, synneoffringes & trespace offringes, for it is an holy place.
{42:14} When the prestes come therin, they shal not go out in to the fore courte: but (seynge they be holy) they shall leaue the clothes of their ministracion, and put on other garmentes, when they haue eny thinge to do with the people.
{42:15} Now when he had measured all the ynnermer house, he brought me forth thorow the east porte, and measured the same rounde aboute.
{42:16} He measured the east syde with ye meterodde, which rounde aboute conteyned v.C.meteroddes.
{42:17} And the north syde measured he, which conteyned rounde aboute euen so moch.
{42:18} The other two sydes also towarde the south
{42:19} and the west (which he measured) conteyned ether of them v.C. meteroddes.
{42:20} So he measured all ye foure sydes where there wente a wall rounde aboute v.C. meteroddes longe, and as brode also, which separated the holy from the vnholy.
{43:1} So he brought me to ye dore, that turneth towarde the east.
{43:2} Beholde, the came the glory of the God of Israel from out of the east, whose voyce was like a greate noyse of waters, and the earth was lightened with his glory.
{43:3} His sight to loke vpon was like the first, that I sawe, when I wente in, what tyme as the cite shulde haue bene destroyed: and like the vision that I sawe by the water of Cobar. Then fell I vpon my face,
{43:4} but the glory of the LORDE came in to the house thorow the eastdore.
{43:5} So a wynde toke me vp, and brought me into ye ynnermer courte: & beholde, the house was full of the glory of the LORDE.
{43:6} I herde one speakinge vnto me out of the house, and there stode one by me,
{43:7} that sayde vnto me: O thou sonne of man, this rowme is my seate, and the place of my fotesteppes: where as I wil dwell amonge the children of Israel for euermore: so that the house of Israel shal nomore defyle my holy name: nether thei, ner their kinges, thorow their whordome, thorow their hie places, & thorow the deed bodies of their kinges:
{43:8} which haue buylded their thresholdes in maner harde vpon my thresholdes, and their postes almost at my postes: so that there is but a bare wall betwixte me and them. Thus haue they defyled my holy name with their abhominacions, that they haue comitted. Wherfore I haue destroyed them in my wrath:
{43:9} But now they shal put awaye their whordome and the deed bodies of their kinges out of my sight, that I maye dwell amoge them for euermore.
{43:10} Therfore (o thou sonne of man) shewe thou the housholde of Israel a temple, that they maye be ashamed of their wickednesse, and measure them selues an example therat.
{43:11} And when they be ashamed of all their workes, then shewe them the fourme and fashion of the temple: the comynge in, the goinge out, all the maner and descripcion therof, yee all the vses and ordinaunces of it, yt they maye kepe & fulfill all the fashions and customes therof.
{43:12} This is the descripcion of the house: Aboue vpo the mount rounde aboute all the corners, it shalbe ye holiest of all. Beholde, that is the descripcion and fashion of the house.
{43:13} This is the measure of the aulter (after the true cubite,: which is a spanne longer then another cubite) his botome in the myddest was a cubite longe and wyde, and the ledge that wente rounde aboute it, was a spanne brode. This is the heyth of the aulter:
{43:14} From the grounde to the lower steppes the length is two cubites, and the bredth one cubite: and from the lower steppes to the higher are foure cubites, & the bredth but one cubite.
{43:15} The aulter was foure cubites hie, & from the aulter vpwarde stode foure hornes,
{43:16} and it was xij cubites longe and xij cubites brode, vpon the foure corners:
{43:17} the coueringe of the aulter was xiiij cubites longe and brode vpon the foure corners, and the ledge that wente rounde aboute, had half a cubite: and the botome therof rounde aboute one cubite: his steppes stode towarde the easte.
{43:18} And he sayde vnto me: Thou sonne of man, thus saieth the LORDE God: these are the ordinaunces and lawes of the aulter, in the daye whe it is made, to offre burntoffringes, and to sprenkle bloude ther vpon.
{43:19} To the prestes, to ye Leuites that be of the sede of Sadoch, and treade before me to do me seruyce, saieth the LORDE God: Vnto these geue thou a yonge bullocke, for a synoffringe:
{43:20} & take the bloude of him & sprenkle his foure hornes withal, & the foure corners of the aulter coueringe, with the ledge that goeth rounde aboute: here with shalt thou clense it, and reconcile it.
{43:21} Thou shalt take the bullock also of the synoffringe, & burne him in a seuerall place without the Sanctuary.
{43:22} The nexte daye, take a gootbuck without blemish for a synoffringe, to reconcile the aulter withall: like as it was reconciled with ye bullocke.
{43:23} Now when thou hast made it clene, then offre a yonge bullocke without blemish, and a ramme out of the flocke without blemish also:
{43:24} Offre them before the LORDE, and let the prest cast salt thervpon, and geue them so vnto the LORDE for a burntoffringe.
{43:25} Seuen dayes shalt thou bringe, euery daye a gootbucke. A yonge bullocke & a ramme of the flocke (both without blemish) shal they offre.
{43:26} Seuen dayes shal they reconcile and clense the aulter, & offre vpon it.
{43:27} When these dayes are expired, then vpon the viij daye and so forth, the prestes shal offre their burntoffringes and healthoffringes vpo ye aulter: so wil I be mercifull vnto you, saieth the LORDE God.
{44:1} After this, he brought me agayne to ye outwarde dore of the Sanctuary on the east syde, and that was shut.
{44:2} Then sayde the LORDE vnto me: This dore shalbe stil shut, and not opened for eny ma to go thorow it, but only for the LORDE God of Israel: yee he shal go thorow it, els shal it be shut still.
{44:3} The prynce himself shal come thorow it, that he maye eate bred before the LORDE. At the porche shal he come in, and there shal he go out agayne.
{44:4} Then brought he me to the dore, vpon the north syde of the house. And as I loked aboute me, beholde, the glory of the LORDE fylled the house: and I fell downe vpon my face.
{44:5} So the LORDE spake vnto me: O thou sonne of man, fasten this to thine herte, beholde, and take diliget hede to all that I wil saye vnto the, concernynge all the ordinaunces of the LORDE and all his lawes: pondre well with thine herte the commynge in of the house and the goinge forth of the Sanctuary:
{44:6} and tell that obstinate housholde of Israel: Thus saieth the LORDE God: O house of Israel, ye haue now done ynough with all youre abhominacios,
{44:7} seynge that ye haue brought in to my Sanctuary straungers, hauynge vncircumcised hertes & flesh, where thorow my Sactuary is defiled, whe ye offre my bred, fat, & bloude. Thus with all youre abhominacions ye haue broken my couenaunt,
{44:8} and not kepte the holy ordinaunces of my Sanctuary: but set kepers of my Sanctuary, euen after youre owne mynde.
{44:9} Therfore thus saieth ye LORDE God: Of all the straungers that dwell amoge the childre of Israel, no straunger (whose herte & flesh is not circumcised) shal come within my Sanctuary:
{44:10} No ner the Leuites that be gone backe fro me, and haue disceaued the people of Israel with erroures, goinge after their Idols: therfore shal thei beare their owne wickednes.
{44:11} Shulde they be set and ordened to ministre, vnder the dores of the house of my Sanctuary? and to do seruyce in the house: to slaye burntoffringes and sacrifices for ye people: to stode before them, and to serue them:
{44:12} seynge the seruyce that they do them, is before their Idols, and cause the house of Israel to stomble thorow wickednesse? For the which cause I haue pluckte out myne honde ouer them (saieth the LORDE) so that now they must beare their owne iniquyte,
{44:13} and not to come nye me, to serue me with their preasheade, in my Sanctuary, and most holyest of all: that they maye beare their owne shame and abhominacions, which they haue done.
{44:14} Shulde I vse them to be porters of the house, and to all the seruyce yt is done therin?
{44:15} But the prestes ye Leuites the sonnes of Sadoch, that kepte the holy ordinaunces of my Sanctuary, when the children of Israel were gone fro me: shal come to me, to do me seruyce, to stonde before me, and to offre me the fat and the bloude, saieth the LORDE God.
{44:16} They shall go in to my Sanctuary, and treade before my table, to do me seruyce, and to waite vpo myne ordinaunces.
{44:17} Now whe they go in at the dores of the ynnermer courte, they shal put on lynnynge clothes, so that no wollyne come vpon them: whyle they do seruyce vnder the dores of ye ynnermer courte, and within.
{44:18} They shal haue fayre lynnynge bonettes vpon their heades, and lynnynge breches vpon their loynes, which in their laboure they shal not put aboute them:
{44:19} And when they go forth to the people in to the outwarde courte, they shal put of the clothes, wherin they haue ministred, and laye them in the habitacion of the Sanctuary, & put on other apparell, lest they onhalowe ye people with their clothes.
{44:20} They shal not shaue their heades, ner norish the bushe of their hayre, but roude their heades only.
{44:21} All the prestes that go in to the ynmost courte, shall drynke no wyne.
{44:22} They shall mary no wydowe, nether one that is put from hir husbonde: but a mayde of the sede of the house of Israel, or a wydowe, that hath had a prest before.
{44:23} They shal shewe my people the difference betwene the holy and vnholy, betwixte the clene and vnclene.
{44:24} Yf eny discorde aryse, they shal discerne it, and geue sentence after my iudgmentes. My solempne feastes, my lawes and ordinaunces shal they kepe, and halowe my Sabbathes.
{44:25} They shal come at no deed persone, to defyle them selues: (excepte it be father or mother, sonne or doughter, brother or sister that hath had yet no husbonde) in soch they maye be defyled.
{44:26} And when he is clensed, there shal be rekened vnto him vij dayes:
{44:27} and yf he go in to the Sanctuary agayne to do seruyce, he shal bringe a synoffringe saieth the LORDE God.
{44:28} They shall haue an heretage, yee I my self wilbe their heretage: els shall ye geue the no possession in Israel, for I am their possession.
{44:29} The meatoffringe, synoffringe & trespace offringe shal they eate, and euery dedicate thinge in Israel, shalbe theirs.
{44:30} The firstlinges of all the first frutes, and all fre will offringes shal be the prestes. Ye shall geue vnto the prest also the firstlinges of youre dowe, that God maye prospere the resydue.
{44:31} But no deed carion shall the prest eate, ner soch as is deuoured of wilde beestes, foules or catell.
{45:1} When ye deuyde the lode by the lott, ye shal put asyde one parte for the LORDE, to be holy from other londes: namely, xxv M meteroddes longe, and x M brode. This shalbe holy, as wyde as it is rounde aboute.
{45:2} Of this parte there shal be longe vnto the Sanctuary v C meteroddes in all the foure corners, and l cubites wyde rounde aboute to the suburbes.
{45:3} And from this meausre, namely of xxv M metteroddes longe, and x M brode, thou shalt measure, wherin the Sanctuary and the holiest of all maye stonde.
{45:4} The resydue of that holy grounde shall be the prestes, which do seruyce in the Sanctuary of the LORDE, and go in before the LORDE to serue him, that they maye haue rowme to dwell in.
{45:5} As for the Sanctuary, it shal stonde for it self: and to the Leuites the serue in that house, there shalbe geuen xx habitacions, of the xxv M legth & x M bredth:
{45:6} ye shal geue also vnto the cite a possessio of v M meteroddes brode, & xxv M longe, besyde the parte of ye Sanctuary: that shal be for the whole house of Israel.
{45:7} Vpon both the sydes of the Sanctuarys parte, & by the cite, there shalbe geuen vnto the prynce, what so euer lyeth ouer agaynst the cite, as farre as reacheth westwarde and eastwarde: which shalbe as longe as one parte, fro ye west vnto ye east.
{45:8} This shalbe his owne lode in Israel, that my princes be no more chargeable vnto my people. And soch as remayneth yet ouer in the londe, shalbe geuen to the house of Israel acordinge to their trybes.
{45:9} Thus saieth the LORDE God: O ye princes, ye haue now oppressed and destroyed ynough: now leaue of, handle now acordinge to the thinge, that is equall and laufull: and thrust out my people nomore, sayeth ye LORDE God.
{45:10} Ye shal haue a true weight, a true Epha, & a true Bat.
{45:11} The Epha & the Bat shalbe a like. One Bat shal coteyne ye teth parte of an Homer, and so shal one Epha do: their measure shalbe after ye Homer.
{45:12} One Sycle maketh xx. Geras. So xx. Sycles, and xxv. & xv. Sycles make a pounde.
{45:13} This is the Heaue offrynge, that ye shal geue to be heaued: namely, the xvj. parte of an Epha, out of an Homer of wheat: and the xvj. parte of an Epha, out of an Homer of barlie.
{45:14} The oyle shalbe measured with the Bat: euen the x. parte of one Bat out of a Cor. Ten Battes make one Homer: for one Homer maketh ten Battes.
{45:15} And one labe from two hundreth shepe out of the pasture of Israel, for a meatoffrynge, burntoffrynge and healthoffrynge, to recocile them, sayeth the LORDE God.
{45:16} All the people of the londe shal geue this heaue offrynge with a frewil.
{45:17} Agayne, it shal be the prynces parte to offre burntoffrynges, meatoffrynges and drynkoffrynges vnto the LORDE, in the holy dayes, new Moones, Sabbathes, and in all the hye feastes of the house of Israel. The synoffrynge, meatofferynge, brentofferynge & healthoffringe shal he geue, to recocile the house of Israel.
{45:18} Thus sayeth ye LORDE God: The first daye of the first moneth thou shalt take a yoge bullocke without blemysh, and clense the Sanctuary.
{45:19} So the prest shal take of the bloude of ye synoffrynge, and sprenkle it vpon the postes of the house, and vpon the foure corners of the aulter, with the dorepostes of the ynnermer courte.
{45:20} And thus shalt thou do also the seuenth daye of ye moneth (for soch as haue synned of ignoraunce, or beynge disceaued) to reconcile the house withall.
{45:21} Vpon ye xiiij. daye of the first moneth ye shal kepe Easter. Seue dayes shal the feast contynue, wherin there shal no sower ner leueded bred be eate.
{45:22} Vpon the same daye shal ye prynce geue for himself and all the people of the londe, a bullocke for a synoffringe.
{45:23} And in the feast of the seuen dayes he shal offre euery daye a bullocke & a ram, that are with out blemysh, for a burntoffrynge vnto the LORDE: & an he gaote daylie for a synoffrynge.
{45:24} For the meatoffrynges he shall geue euer an Epha to a bullocke, an Epha to a ram, & an Hin of oyle to an Epha.
{45:25} Vpon ye xv. daye of the seuenth moneth, he shal kepe the seuen dayes holy one after another, eue as the other vij. dayes: with the synoffrynge, burntoffringe, meatoffrynge, and with the oyle.
{46:1} Thus sayeth the LORDE God: ye dore of the ynnermer courte towarde the east, shall be shut the vj. worke dayes: but in the Sabbath and in the daye of the new Moone, it shalbe opened.
{46:2} Then shal the prynce come vnder the dore porche, & stonde still without by the dore cheke. So ye prestes shall offre vp his burnt & healthoffrynges. And he shal worshipe at the dore poste, and go his waye forth agayne: but ye dore shal nomore be shut till the euenynge.
{46:3} On the same maner shal the people of the londe also do their worshipe before the LORDE, without this dore vpon the Sabbathes and new Moones.
{46:4} This is now the burntoffrynge, that the prynce shall bringe vnto the LORDE vpon the Sabbath: sixe lambes without blemysh, & a ram without blemysh,
{46:5} and an Epha for a meatoffringe, with ye ram. As for the lambes, he maye geue as many meatoffrynges to them, as he wil, & an Hin of oyle to an Epha.
{46:6} In the daye of the new moneth, it shalbe a yonge bullocke without blemysh, sixe lambes & a ram also without blemysh.
{46:7} With the bullocke he shal geue an Epha, and with the ram an Epha also for a meatofferinge: but to ye lambes, what he maye come by: And euer an Hin of oyle to an Epha.
{46:8} When the prynce cometh, he shall go vnder the dore porche, and euen there departe forth agayne.
{46:9} But when the people of the londe come before the LORDE in the hye solempne feast, as many as come in by the north dore to do worshipe, shal go out agayne at the south dore. And they that come in at the south dore, shal go forth agayne at ye north dore. There shal none go out at the dore where he came in, but shal go forth right ouer on the other syde,
{46:10} and the prynce shall go in and out amonge them.
{46:11} Vpon the solempne and hie feaste dayes, this shalbe the meatofferynge: An Epha to a bullock, and an Epha to a ram: and to the lambes, as many as he wil, but euer an Hin of oyle to an Epha.
{46:12} Now when the prynce bryngeth a burntofferynge or an healthofferynge with a fre wil vnto the LORDE, the east dore shalbe opened vnto him, yt he maye do with his burnt & healthofferynges, as he doth vpo the Sabbath: and when he goeth forth, the dore shal be shut after him agayne.
{46:13} He shal daylie brynge vnto the LORDE a lambe of a yeare olde without blemish for a burntofferynge: this shall he do euery mornynge.
{46:14} And for a meatofferynge he shal geue the sixte parte of an Epha, & the thirde parte of an Hin of oyle (to myngle with the cakes) euery mornynge. Yee this shalbe a daylie meatofferinge vnto the LORDE, for an euerlastinge ordinaunce:
{46:15} & thus shal the lambe, the meatofferynge and oyle be geuen euery mornynge, for a dailie burntofferinge.
{46:16} Morouer, thus sayeth the LORDE God: Yf the prynce geue a gifte vnto eny of his sonnes, then shall it be his sonnes heretage perpetuall, yt he maye possesse it.
{46:17} But yf he wil geue one of his seruauntes some of his heretage, it shall be his to the fre yeare, and the to returne agayne vnto ye prynce: for his heretage shalbe his sonnes only.
{46:18} The prynce also shal take none of the peoples enheritaunce, ner put the from their possession: but to his owne sonnes shal he geue his possession, that my people be not scatred abrode, but that euery man maye haue his owne.
{46:19} And he brought me thorow the intraunce at the syde of the dore to ye habitacion of the Sanctuary, that belongeth to ye prestes and stode towarde the north, & beholde, there was a place vpon the west syde,
{46:20} then sayde he vnto me: This is the place, where the prestes shall dight the trespace and synofferynges, & bake ye meatofferynges: that they nede not beare the in to the outwarde courte, and so to vnhalowe the people.
{46:21} So he brought me in to the vttemost courte, rounde aboute all the foure corners. Beholde, in euery corner of ye fore courte, there was yet a litle courte.
{46:22} Yee in all the foure corners of the courte, there was made a litle courte of xl. cubites longe, and xxx. cubites brode: these foure litle courtes were of one like measure,
{46:23} & there went a rygge wall rounde aboute them all foure, vnder the which there were harthes made rounde aboute.
{46:24} Then sayde he vnto me: This is the kechin, where the ministers of the house shal dight the slayne offerynges of the people.
{47:1} After this he brought me agayne before the dore of the house: & beholde, there gusshed out waters from vnder ye postes of the house eastwarde (for the house stode towarde the east) that ranne downe vpo the right syde of the house, which lyeth to the aulter south warde.
{47:2} The caried he me out to the north dore, and brought me forth there rounde aboute by the vttemost dore, yt turneth eastwarde. Beholde, there came forth the water vpon the right syde.
{47:3} Now whan the man yt had the meterodde in his honde wente out vnto the east dore, he measured a M. cubites, & the he brought me thorow ye water, eue to the ancles:
{47:4} so he measured yet a thousande, & brought me thorow ye water agayne vnto the knees: yet measured he a thousande, and brought me thorow the water vnto the loynes.
{47:5} After this he measured a thousande agayne, then was it soch a ryuer, yt I might not wade thorow it: The water was so depe, that it was nedefull to haue swymmed, for it might not be waded ouer.
{47:6} And he sayde vnto me: hast thou sene this, o thou sonne of man? and with that, he brought me to the ryuer banck agayne.
{47:7} Now when I came there, there stode many trees vpon ether syde of the ryuer backe.
{47:8} Then sayde he vnto me: This water that floweth out towarde the east, and runneth downe in to the playne felde, commeth in to the see: and from the see it runneth out, & maketh the waters whole.
{47:9} Yee all that liue and moue, where vnto this ryuer commeth, shal recouer. And where this water cometh, there shalbe many fysh. For all that commeth to this water, shall be lusty and whole.
{47:10} By this riuer shal the fysshers stonde from Engaddi vnto En Eglaim, & there sprede out their nettes: for there shalbe greate heapes of fysh, like as in the mayne see.
{47:11} As for his claye and pyttes, they shal not be whole, for why, it shalbe occupide for salt.
{47:12} By this ryuer vpon both the sydes of the shore, there shall growe all maner of frutefull trees, whose leaues shall not fall of, nether shal their frute perish: but euer be rype at their monethes, for their water runneth out of the Sanctuary. His frute is good to eate, and his leaf profitable for medycine.
{47:13} Thus sayeth the LORDE God: Let this be the border, wherin ye shall deuyde the londe vnto the xij. trybes of Israel, with the lyne.
{47:14} Parte it indifferently vnto one as vnto another: of the which lode I swore vnto youre fathers, that it shulde fall to youre enheritaunce.
{47:15} This is the border of the londe vpon the northsyde, from the mayne see, as men go to Zadada:
{47:16} namely, Hemath, Berotha, Sabarim: from the borders of Damascus and Hemath vnto Hazar Tichon, that lieth vpon the coastes of Hauera.
{47:17} Thus the borders fro the see forth, shalbe Hazar Euan, the border of Damascus the north, and the borders of Hemath: that is the north parte.
{47:18} The east syde shal ye measure from Haueran and Damascus, from Galead and the londe of Israel by Iordane and so forth, from the see coast, that lieth eastwarde: and this is the east parte.
{47:19} The south syde is, from Thamar forth to the waters of strife vnto Cades, the ryuer, to the mayne see: and that is the south parte.
{47:20} The west parte: namely the greate see from the borders therof, till a man come vnto Hemath: this is the west parte.
{47:21} This londe shal ye parte amonge you, acordinge to the trybes of Israel,
{47:22} and deuyde it to be an heretage for you, and for the straugers that dwel amoge you, and begette children. For ye shal take them amonge the childre of Israell, like as though they were of youre owne housholde and countre, and they shal haue heretage with you amonge the childre of Israel.
{47:23} Loke in what trybe the straunger dwelleth, in the same trybe shal ye geue him his heretage, saieth the LORDE God.
{48:1} These are ye names of the trybes that lye vpon the northsyde by the waye of Hetlon, tyll thou commest vnto Hemath and Hazar Enam, the borders of Damascus towarde the north besyde Hemath: Dan shal haue his porcio from the east quarter vnto the west.
{48:2} Vpon the borders of Dan from the east syde vnto the west, shal Asser haue his porcion.
{48:3} Vpon the borders of Asser fro the east parte vnto the west, shal Nephtali haue his porcion.
{48:4} Vpon the borders of Nephtali from the east quarter vnto the west, shal Manasses haue his porcion.
{48:5} Vpon the borders of Manasses from the east syde vnto the west, shal Ephraim haue his porcion.
{48:6} Vpon the borders of Ephraim from the east parte vnto the west, shal Ruben haue his porcion.
{48:7} Vpo the borders of Ruben from the east quarter vnto the west, shal Iuda haue his porcion.
{48:8} Vpon the borders of Iuda from the east parte vnto the west, ye shal set a syde one porcio of xxv.M. meteroddes longe and brode (like as another porcion from the east syde vnto the west,) wherin the Sanctuary shal stode.
{48:9} As for the porcion, that ye shal separate out for the LORDE, it shalbe xxv.M. longe, and x.M. brode.
{48:10} Which separated holy porcion shal belonge vnto these: namely to the prestes, towarde the north xxv.M. & towarde the west x.M. brode, towarde the east x. M. brode also, & towarde the south xxv.M. longe, wherin the Sanctuary of the LORDE shal stonde.
{48:11} Yee this same place shal be the prestes, yt are of the childre of Sadoch, & haue kepte my holy ordinaunce: which wente not astraye in the erroure of the children of Israel, like as the Leuites are gone astraye:
{48:12} and this separated pece that they haue of the londe, shalbe the most holy, harde vpon the borders of the Leuites.
{48:13} And nexte vnto the prestes, shal the Leuites haue xxv.M. loge and x.M. brode. This shalbe on euery syde xxv. M. longe, and x. M. brode.
{48:14} Of this porcio they shal sell nothinge, ner make eny permutacion therof, lest the chefe of the londe fall vnto other, for it is halowed vnto the LORDE.
{48:15} The other v.M. after the bredth, yt lyeth by the xxv.M, shalbe comon: it shal belonge to the cite and to the suburbes for habitacions, and ye cite shal stonde in the myddest therof.
{48:16} Let this be the measure: towarde ye north parte, v.C. & iiij.M: towarde the south parte, v.C. & iiij.M: towarde the east parte, v.C. and iiij.M: towarde ye west parte, v.C. and iiij.M.
{48:17} The suburbes harde vpon the cite, shall haue towarde the north, L. and ij.C: towarde the south, L. and two C: towarde the east, L. and two C: towarde the west also, L. and two C.
{48:18} As for the residue of the length, that lyeth hard vpon the separated holy grounde: namely, x.M. towarde the east and x.M. towarde the west, next vnto the holy porcio: it and the increase therof shal serue for their meate, that laboure in the cite.
{48:19} They that laboure for the welth of the cite, shall manteine this also, out of what tribe so euer they be in Israel.
{48:20} All that is separated of the xxv.M. longe and xxv.M. brode on the foure partes, yt shall ye put a syde for the separated porcion of the Sanctuary, & for the possession of ye cite.
{48:21} The resydue vpon both the sydes of the Sanctuary and possession of the cite, shall belonge to the prynce, before the place of ye xxv.M. vnto the east ende, & before the place of ye xxv.M. westwarde, vnto the borders of ye cite: this shalbe ye prynces porcio. This shalbe the holy place, and the house of the Sanctuary shal stonde in the myddest.
{48:22} Morouer, from the Leuites and the cities possession, yt lye in the myddest of the prynces parte: loke what remayneth betwixte the border of Iuda & the border of Ben Iamin, it shalbe the prynces.
{48:23} Now of the other trybes. Fro the east parte vnto the west, shal Ben Iamin haue his porcion.
{48:24} Vpon the borders of Ben Iamin fro the east syde vnto ye west, shal Symeon haue his porcion.
{48:25} Vpon the borders of Symeo from the east parte vnto the west, shal Isachar haue his porcion.
{48:26} Vpo the borders of Isachar from the east syde vnto the west, shal Sabulon haue his porcion.
{48:27} Vpon the borders of Sabulon from the east parte vnto the west, shal Gad haue his porcion.
{48:28} Vpon the borders of Gad southwarde, the coastes shal reach fro Thamar forth vnto the waters of strife to Cades, and to the floude, euen vnto the mayne see.
{48:29} This is ye lode wt his porcios, which ye shal distribute vnto the trybes of Israel, saieth ye LORDE God.
{48:30} Thus wyde shal the cite reach: vpon the north parte v C and iiij M measures.
{48:31} The portes of the cite, shal haue the names of the trybes of Israel. Thre portes of ye northsyde: One Ruben, another Iuda, the thirde Leui.
{48:32} Vpo ye east syde, v C & iiij M measures, wt ye thre portes: The one Ioseph, another Be Iamin, the thirde Dan.
{48:33} Vpon the south syde v C and iiij M measures, with the thre portes: the one Symeon, another Isachar, the thirde Sabulon.
{48:34} And vpon the west syde v C and iiij M measures, with thre portes also: the one Gad, another Asser, the thirde Nephtali.
{48:35} Thus shal it haue xviij M measures roude aboute. And from that tyme forth, ye name of the cite shalbe: the LORDE is there.

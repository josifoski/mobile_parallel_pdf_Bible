{1:1} Paul an Apostle of Iesu Christ by the will of God, and brother Timotheus.
{1:2} To ye sayntes which are at Colossa and brethren that beleue in Christ. Grace be with you and peace from God oure father & fro the LORDE Iesus Christ.
{1:3} We geue thankes vnto God and the father of oure LORDE Iesus Christ, prayenge allwayes for you
{1:4} (sence we herde of youre faith in Christ Iesu, and of youre loue to all sayntes)
{1:5} for ye hopes sake which is layed vp in stoare for you in heauen: of the which ye haue herde before by the worde of trueth in the Gospell,
{1:6} which is come vnto you, eue as it is into all the worlde: and is frutefull, as it is in you, sence ye daye yt ye herde and knewe the grace of God in ye trueth,
{1:7} as ye learned of Epaphras oure deare felowe seruaunt, which is a faithfull mynister of Christ for you,
{1:8} which also declared vnto vs youre loue in the sprete.
{1:9} For this cause we also, sence the daye yt we herde of it, ceasse not to praye for you, & desyre that ye mighte be fulfylled with the knowlege of his will, in all wyssdome and spirituall vnderstondinge,
{1:10} that ye mighte walke worthy off the LORDE, to please him in all thinges, and to be frutefull in all good workes, and growe in the knowlege of God:
{1:11} & to be strengthed wt all power acordinge to the mighte of his glory, to all pacience and longsufferynge with ioyfulnes,
{1:12} and geue thankes vnto the father, which hath made vs mete for the enheritaunce of sayntes in lighte.
{1:13} Which hath delyuered vs fro the power of darknesse, & translated vs in to the kyngdome of his deare sonne
{1:14} ( in whom we haue redempcion thorow his bloude, namely, the forgeuenes of synnes.)
{1:15} Which is the ymage of the inuisyble God, first begotte before all creatures.
{1:16} For by him were all thinges created, that are in heauen and earth, thinges vysible and thinges inuysible, whether they be maiesties or lordshippes, ether rules or powers: All thinges are created by him and in him,
{1:17} and he is before all thinges, and in him all thinges haue their beynge.
{1:18} And he is the heade of the body, namely, of the cogregacion: he is the begynnynge and first begotten from the deed, that in all thinges he mighte haue the preemynence.
{1:19} For it pleased the father, that in him shulde dwell all fulnesse,
{1:20} and that by him all thinges shulde be reconciled vnto himselfe, whether they be thinges vpon earth or in heauen, that thorow the bloude on his crosse he mighte make peace euen thorow his owne selfe.
{1:21} And you (which were in tymes past straungers and enemies, because youre myndes were set in euell workes) hath he now reconcyled
{1:22} in the body of his flesh thorow death, to make you holy, and vnblameable & with out faute in his awne sighte,
{1:23} yf ye contynue grounded and stablished in the faith, and be not moued awaye from ye hope of the Gospell, wherof ye haue herde: which is preached amonge all creatures yt are vnder heauen, wherof I Paul am made a mynister.
{1:24} Now ioye I in my sufferynges, which I suffre for you, and fulfill that which is behynde of the passions of Christ in my flesh, for his bodyes sake, which is the congregacion,
{1:25} wherof I am made a mynister, acordinge to ye Godly office of preachinge, which is geuen vnto me amonge you, that I shulde richely preach the worde of God,
{1:26} namely, that mystery which hath bene hyd sence the worlde beganne, and sence the begynnynge of tymes: but now is opened vnto his sayntes,
{1:27} to whom God wolde make knowne the glorious riches of this mistery amoge ye Heythen: which (riches) is Christ in you, eue he that is the hope of glory,
{1:28} who we preach, and warne all men, and teach all men in all wyssdome, to make euery man parfecte in Christ Iesu:
{1:29} Wherin I also laboure, and stryue acordinge to the workynge of him which worketh mightely in me.
{2:1} I wolde ye knewe what fightinge I haue for youre sakes, and for them of Laodicea, and for as many as haue not sene my personne in the flesh,
{2:2} that their hertes mighte be comforted and knytt together in loue, to all riches of full vnderstodinge, which is in the knowlege of the mystery of God the father and of Christ,
{2:3} in whom are hyd all the treasures of wyssdome and knowlege.
{2:4} This I saye, lest eny man shulde begyle you with entysinge wordes.
{2:5} For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I present with you in the sprete: ioyenge, and beholdinge youre order and the stedfastnes of youre faith in Christ.
{2:6} As ye haue therfore receaued Christ Iesu the LORDE, euen so walke in him,
{2:7} and be roted & buylded in him, and be stedfast in faith, as ye haue learned: & be plenteous in the same in geuynge thankes.
{2:8} Bewarre lest eny ma spoyle you thorow philosophy and disceatfull vanite after the tradicions of men, and after the ordinauces of the worlde, and not after Christ.
{2:9} For in him dwelleth all the fulnes of the Godheade bodely,
{2:10} and ye are complete in him, which is the heade of all rule and power:
{2:11} in whom also ye are circumcysed with circumcision without handes, by puttynge of the synfull body of the flesh: (namely) with the circumcysion of Christ,
{2:12} in that ye are buried with him thorow baptyme: in whom ye are also rysen agayne thorow faith, that is wrought by the operacion of God, which raysed him vp from the deed.
{2:13} And with him he quyckened you, whan ye were deed in synnes, and in the vncircumcision of youre flesh, and hath forgeuen vs all synnes,
{2:14} and put out the handwrytinge that was agaynst vs (cotayned in the lawe wrytten) and that hath he taken out of the waye, and fastened it to the crosse:
{2:15} And hath spoyled rule and power, and hath made a shewe of them openly, and triumphed ouer them in his awne persone.
{2:16} Let no man therfore trouble youre consciences aboute meate or drynke, or for a pece of an holy daye, as the holy daye of ye newe Mone, or of the Sabbath dayes,
{2:17} which are the shadowe of the thinges that were for to come: but the body selfe is in Christ.
{2:18} Let no man make you shote at a wronge mark, which after his owne chosynge walketh in humblenes and spiritualtye of angels, thinges which he neuer sawe, and is vayne, and puft vp in his owne fleshly mynde:
{2:19} and holdeth not himselfe to the heade, wherof the whole body by ioyntes and couples receaueth norishment, and is knyt together, and so groweth to the greatnes that commeth of God.
{2:20} Wherfore yf ye be deed with Christ from the ordinaunces of the worlde, why are ye holden the with soch tradicions, as though ye lyued after the worlde? As whan they saye:
{2:21} Touch not this, taist not that, handle not that.
{2:22} All these thinges do hurte vnto men, because of the abuse of them, which abuse commeth onely of the commaundementes and doctrynes of men:
{2:23} which thinges haue a shyne of wyssdome thorow chosen spiritualtie and humblenes, and in that they spare not the body, and do the flesh no worshipe vnto his nede.
{3:1} Yf ye be rysen now with Christ, seke those thinges then which are aboue where Christ is, syttinge on the righte hande of God.
{3:2} Set youre mynde on the thinges which are aboue, not on ye thinges that are vpon earth.
{3:3} For ye are deed, and youre life is hyd with Christ in God.
{3:4} But whan Christ or life shal shewe himselfe, the shal ye also appeare with him in glory.
{3:5} Mortifye therfore youre mebres which are vpon earth, whordome, vnclennes, vnnaturall lust, euell concupiscece, and couetousnes, which is a worshippynge of Idols:
{3:6} for which thinges sakes the wrath of God commeth vpon the children of vnbeleue:
{3:7} in the which thinges ye walked some tyme, whan ye lyued in them.
{3:8} But now put all awaye fro you: wrath, fearcenesse, maliciousnes, cursed speakynge, fylthie wordes out of youre mouth.
{3:9} Lye not one to another. Put of ye olde ma with his workes,
{3:10} and put on ye newe, which is renued in knowlege after ye ymage of him that made him:
{3:11} where there is no Greke, Iewe, circumcision, vncircumcision, Barbarous, Sithian, bode, fre: but Christ is all and in all.
{3:12} Now therfore as the electe of God, holy and beloued, put on tender mercye, kyndnes, humblenes of mynde, mekenesse, longe sufferynge,
{3:13} forbearinge one another, and forgeuynge one another, yf eny man haue a quarell agaynst another. Like as Christ hath forgeuen you, euen so do ye also.
{3:14} But aboue all thinges put on loue, which is the bonde of perfectnesse.
{3:15} And the peace of God rule in youre hertes, to the which (peace) ye are called also in one body: and se yt ye be thanfull.
{3:16} Let ye worde of Christ dwell in you plenteously in all wyssdome. Teach and exhorte youre awne selues with psalmes and ymnes, and spirituall songes which haue fauoure with them, synginge in youre hertes to the LORDE.
{3:17} And what soeuer ye do in worde or worke, do all in the name of the LORDE Iesu, and geue thankes vnto God the father by him.
{3:18} Ye wyues, submytte youre selues vnto youre hussbandes, as it is comly in the LORDE.
{3:19} Ye hussbandes, loue youre wyues, and be not bytter vnto them.
{3:20} Ye children, obeye youre elders in all thinges, for that is well pleasynge vnto the LORDE.
{3:21} Ye fathers, rate not yor children, lest they be of a desperate mynde.
{3:22} Ye seruauntes, be obedient vnto youre bodely masters in all thinges, not with eye seruyce as men pleasers, but in synglenes of hert, fearinge God.
{3:23} What so euer ye do, do it hertely, euen as vnto the LORDE and not vnto men.
{3:24} And be sure, that of the LORDE ye shal receaue the rewarde of ye enheritaunce: For ye serue the LORDE Christ.
{3:25} But he that doth wronge, shal receaue for the wronge that he hath done, for there is no respecte of persons (with God.)
{4:1} Ye masters, do vnto youre seruauntes that which is iust and equall, and knowe, yt ye also haue a master in heauen.
{4:2} Contynue in prayer, and watch in the same with thankesgeuynge,
{4:3} and praye also together for vs, that God open vnto vs the dore of the worde, to speake the mystery of Christ (wherfore I am also in bodes)
{4:4} that I maye vtter ye same, as it becommeth me to speake.
{4:5} Walke wysely towarde them that are without, and redeme ye tyme.
{4:6} Let youre speach be allwaye fauorable, seasoned with salt, that ye maye knowe how to answere euery man.
{4:7} Tichicus the deare brother and faithfull mynister & felowe seruaut in ye LORDE, shal tell you what case I am in.
{4:8} Whom I haue sent vnto you for the same purpose, that he mighte knowe how ye do, & that he mighte comforte youre hertes,
{4:9} with one Onesimus a faithfull and beloued brother, which is one of you: they shal shewe you of all thinges, which are adoynge here
{4:10} Aristarchus my preson felowe saluteth you, and Marcus Barnabasses sisters sonne, touchinge whom ye receaued commaundementes: Yf he come vnto you, receaue him,
{4:11} and Iesus, which is called Iustus, which are of the circumcision. These onely are my helpers in the kyngdome of God, which were to my consolacion.
{4:12} Epaphras a seruaunt of Christ, which is one of you, saluteth you, & allwaye laboureth feruently for you in prayers, yt ye maye stonde perfecte and full, in all that is the wil of God.
{4:13} I beare him recorde, that he hath a feruent mynde for you, and for the at Laodicea, and at Hierapolis.
{4:14} Deare Lucas the Phisician saluteth you, and so doth Demas.
{4:15} Salute the brethre, which are at Laodicea, and salute Nymphas, and the cogregacion which is in his house.
{4:16} And whan the epistle is red of you, cause it to be red also in the cogregacio at Laodicea, & that ye likewyse reade the epistle of Laodicea.
{4:17} And saye to Archippus: Take hede to the office which thou hast receaued in the LORDE, that thou fulfyll it.
{4:18} My salutacion with the hnade of me Paul. Remembre my bodes. Grace be with you, Amen.

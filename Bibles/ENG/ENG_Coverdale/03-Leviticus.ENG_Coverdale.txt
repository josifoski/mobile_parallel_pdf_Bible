{1:1} And the LORDE called Moses, and spake vnto him out of ye Tabernacle of wytnesse, and sayde:
{1:2} Speake vnto ye childre of Israel, & saie vnto them: Who so euer amoge you wyl brynge an offerynge vnto the LORDE, let him brynge it of ye catell, euen of the oxen, & of the shepe.
{1:3} Yf he wyl brynge a burntofferynge of ye oxen (or greate catell) the let him offre a male without blemysh, before ye dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse, to reconcyle himself before the LORDE,
{1:4} let him laye his hande vpon the heade of the burntofferynge, then shal he be reconcyled, so yt God shalbe mercifull vnto him.
{1:5} And he shall kyll the yonge oxe before ye LORDE: and ye prestes Aarons sonnes shal brynge the bloude, and sprenkle it rounde aboute vpon the altare, that is before the dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse.
{1:6} And the skynne shalbe flayne from of the burntofferynge, and it shalbe hewen in peces.
{1:7} And the sonnes of Aaron the prest shal make a fyre vpon the altare,
{1:8} and laye wod aboue theron: and ye peces, the heade, and the fatt shal they laye vpon the wodd that lyeth vpon ye fyre on the altare.
{1:9} But ye bowels & legges shal be wasshen with water, and the prest shal burne alltogether vpon the altare for a burntsacrifice: this is an offerynge of a swete sauoure vnto the LORDE.
{1:10} Yf he wyl offre a burntsacrifice of the small catell, that is, of the lambes or goates, then let him offre a male without a blemysh.
{1:11} And he shall kyll it before the LORDE, euen at the corner of the altare on the north syde before ye LORDE. And (the prestes) Aarons sonnes shal sprenkle his bloude rounde aboute vpon ye altare,
{1:12} and it shal be hewen in peces. And the prest shall laye them with the heade and the fatt, vpon the wodd that lyeth vpon the fyre on the altare.
{1:13} But the bowels and ye legges shal be wasshen with water. And ye prest shal offre it alltogether, and burne it vpon ye altare for a burntsacrifice. This is an offerynge of a swete sauoure vnto the LORDE.
{1:14} But yf he wil offre a burntsacrifice of ye foules vnto the LORDE, then let him offre it of the turtill doues or of ye yonge pigeons.
{1:15} And the prest shal brynge it vnto the altare, and wrynge the neck of it a sunder, that it maye be burnt vpon the altare, and let the bloude of it runne out vpon the sydes of the altare,
{1:16} and the croppe of it with the fethers shalbe cast vpon the heape of asshes besyde the altare towarde the east,
{1:17} and he shall deuyde the wynges of it, but not breake the cleane of. And thus shall the prest burne it vpon the altare, euen vpon the wodd that lyeth vpo the fyre, for a burntsacrifice. This is an offerynge of a swete sauoure vnto the LORDE.
{2:1} Whan a soule wyll offre a meatofferynge vnto the LORDE, then shal it be of fyne floure, and he shal poure oyle vpon it, and put frankencense theron,
{2:2} & so brynge it vnto Aarons sonnes the prestes. Then shal one of them take his handefull of the same floure, and oyle with all the frankecense, and burne it for a remembraunce vpon the altare. This is an offeringe of a swete sauoure vnto the LORDE.
{2:3} As for ye remnaunt of the meatofferynge, it shalbe Aarons and his sonnes. This shalbe ye most holy of the offerynges of the LORDE.
{2:4} But yf he wyll brynge a meatofferynge of that which is baken in the ouen, then let him take swete cakes of wheate, mixte with oyle, and vnleuended wafers anoynted with oyle.
{2:5} Neuertheles yf thy meatofferynge be enythinge of that which is fryed in the panne, then shal it be of fyne swete floure myxte with oyle:
{2:6} And thou shalt cut it in peces, & poure oyle theron: so is it a meatofferynge.
{2:7} But yf thy meatofferinge be ought broyled on the gredyron, then shalt thou make it of fyne floure with oyle.
{2:8} And the meatofferynge that thou wilt make of soch thinges for the LORDE, shalt thou brynge vnto ye prest, which shal brynge it vnto the altare,
{2:9} & shal Heue vp the same meatofferynge for a remebraunce, and burne it vpon the altare. This is an offerynge of a swete sauoure vnto the LORDE.
{2:10} As for the remnaunt, it shal be Aarons and his sonnes. This shall be the most holy of the offerynges of the LORDE.
{2:11} All the meatofferynges that ye wil offre vnto the LORDE, shal ye make without leue. For there shal no leue nor hony be burnt for an offerynge vnto the LORDE.
{2:12} But for the offerynge of the firstlinges shal ye offer the vnto the LORDE. Neuertheles they shal come vpon no altare for a swete sauoure.
{2:13} All thy meatofferynges shalt thou salt. And thy meatofferynge shal neuer be without ye salt of the couenaunt of thy God: for in all thy offerynges shalt thou offre salt.
{2:14} But yf thou wilt offre a meatofferynge of the first frutes vnto ye LORDE, then shalt thou drye that which is grene, by the fyre, & beate it small, and so offre the meatofferynge of thy first frutes.
{2:15} And thou shalt put oyle vpon it, and laye frankecense theron, so is it a meatofferynge.
{2:16} And then shall the prest beate it, and burne of the oyle with all the frankecense for a remembraunce. This is an offerynge vnto the LORDE.
{3:1} Bvt yf his offerynge be a deedofferinge of greate catell (whether it be oxe or cowe) then shal he offre soch as is without blemysh before the LORDE,
{3:2} & shal laie his hande vpon the heade of it, and kyll it before the dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse. And the prestes Aarons sonnes, shall sprenkle the bloude rounde aboute vpon the altare,
{3:3} and shal offre of ye deadofferynge vnto the LORDE: namely, all the fat that is within,
{3:4} and the two kydneyes with the fat that is theron vpon the loynes, and the nett on the leuer vpo the kydneyes also.
{3:5} And Aarons sonnes shal burne it vpon the altare for a burntofferynge, euen vpon the wod that lyeth on the fyre. This is an offerynge of a swete sauoure vnto the LORDE.
{3:6} Yf his deadofferynge be of small catell, whether it be male or female, it shal be without blemish:
{3:7} Yf it be a lambe, then shall he brynge it before the LORDE,
{3:8} & shal laye his hande vpon the heade of it, and sleye it before the Tabernacle of wytnesse. And Aarons sonnes shal sprenkle his bloude rounde aboute vpon the altare,
{3:9} and so offre of the deadofferynge vnto the LORDE: namely, the fat of it, all the rompe with the backe, and the fat that couereth the bowels, with all ye fat that is within,
{3:10} and the two kydneys with the fat that is theron vpon the loynes, & the nett on the leuer vpon the kydneys also.
{3:11} And the prest shal burne it vpon the altare, for ye meate of the offerynge vnto ye LORDE.
{3:12} But yf his offeringe be a goate, and bringeth it before the LORDE,
{3:13} he shal laye his hande vpon the heade of it, and kyll it before the Tabernacle of wytnesse. And Aarons sonnes shal sprekle the bloude rounde aboute vpo the altare,
{3:14} & shal offer therof a sacrifice vnto the LORDE: namely, the fat yt couereth the bowels, and all the fat yt is within,
{3:15} the two kydneys with the fat that is theron vpon the loynes, & the net on the leuer vpon the kydneys.
{3:16} And the prest shal burne it vpo the altare, for the meate of the sacrifice to a swete sauoure.
{3:17} All the fatt is the LORDES. Let this be a perpetuall lawe amonge yor posterities in all youre dwellynges, that ye eate no fatt, ner bloude.
{4:1} And the LORDE spake vnto Moses, & sayde:
{4:2} Speake vnto the childre of Israel, and saye: Whan a soule synneth thorow ignoraunce in any commaundemet of the LORDE, which he ought not to do: As namely,
{4:3} yf a prest which is anoynted, synne, that he make the people do amysse, he shall brynge for ye synne that he hath done, a yonge bullocke without blemysh vnto the LORDE for a synofferynge.
{4:4} And the bullocke shal he brynge to the dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse before the LORDE, & laie his hade vpo his heade, & kyll him before ye LORDE.
{4:5} And ye prest yt is anoynted, shal take of his bloude, & brynge it in to the Tabernacle of wytnesse.
{4:6} And he shall dyppe his fynger in to the bloude, & sprenkle therwith seue tymes before the LORDE, towarde the vayle of ye Holy.
{4:7} And he shal put of the same bloude vpon the hornes of the altare of incense, yt stondeth before ye LORDE in the Tabernacle of wytnesse: & all the bloude of the bullocke shal he poure vpon the botome of the altare of burntofferinges, yt stondeth at the entringe in of ye Tabernacle of wytnesse.
{4:8} And all the fat of the synofferynge shal he Heue vp: namely, the fat yt couereth the bowels, & all the fat yt is within,
{4:9} ye two kydneys with the fatt that is theron vpon the loynes, and the net on the leuer vpon the kydneys also
{4:10} (like as he Heueth it from the oxe in the deadofferynge) and shall burne it vpon the altare of burntofferynges.
{4:11} But the skynne of the bullocke, and all the flesh, with the heade & legges, & the bowels and the donge,
{4:12} shal he cary alltogether out of the hoost, in to a cleane place, where ye asshes are poured out, & shal burne it vpon wodd with fyre.
{4:13} Whan the whole cogregacion of Israel synneth thorow ignorauce, & the dede be hyd from their eyes, so yt they do ought agaynst eny of the comaundementes of the LORDE, which they shulde not do,
{4:14} & come afterwarde to the knowlege of the synne that they haue done, they shal bringe a yonge bullocke for a synofferynge, and set him before ye dore of ye Tabernacle of wytnesse.
{4:15} And the Elders of the congregacion shall laye their handes vpon his heade before the LORDE, & kyll ye bullocke before the LORDE.
{4:16} And ye prest yt is anoynted shal brynge of ye bullockes bloude into the Tabernacle of wytnesse,
{4:17} & dyppe ther in with his fynger, and sprenkle therwith seuen tymes before the LORDE, eue before the vayle of the Holy.
{4:18} And shall put of the bloude vpon the hornes of the altare, yt stondeth before the LORDE in the Tabernacle of wytnesse: & all ye other bloude shal he poure vpo the botome of ye altare of burntofferynges, yt stondeth before the dore of ye Tabernacle of wytnesse.
{4:19} But all his fatt shal he Heue vp, & burne it vpo the altare:
{4:20} & shal do with this bullocke, as he dyd with ye bullocke of the synofferinge: Thus the prest shal make an attonement for them, & it shall be forgeuen them.
{4:21} And the bullocke shall he brynge without the hoost, and burne him, as he brent ye first bullocke. This shalbe ye synofferynge of the congregacion.
{4:22} Whan a prynce synneth, & doth agaynst the comaundement of the LORDE his God, yt he ought not to do, & offendeth ignorauntly, & commeth to the knowlege
{4:23} of his synne yt he hath done, he shal bringe for his offeringe an he goate without blemysh,
{4:24} & laye his hande vpo the goates heade, & slaye him in ye place where ye burntofferinges are slayne before ye LORDE.
{4:25} The shal ye prest take of ye bloude of ye synofferinge wt his fynger, and put it vpon the altare of burntofferynges, & poure the other bloude vpon the botome of the altare of burntofferynges.
{4:26} But all the fat of it shal he burne vpo the altare, like as the fat of the healthofferynge. And so the prest shal make an attonement for his synne, and it shal be forgeuen him.
{4:27} Wha a soule of ye comon people synneth ignorauntly, doinge eny thinge agaynst the comaundement of the LORDE, yt he ought not to do, & so offendeth,
{4:28} & cometh to ye knowlege of the synne yt he hath done, he shal bringe for his offerynge a she goate without blemysh, for the synne yt he hath done,
{4:29} and shal laye his hande vpon the heade of the synofferynge, & slaye it in the place of the burntofferynges.
{4:30} And the prest shall take of the bloude wt his fynger, & put it vpon the hornes of ye altare of burntofferynges, & poure all the bloude vpon the botome of the altare.
{4:31} But all the fat of it shal he take awaye, like as he taketh awaye the fat of the deadofferynge, and shal burne it vpon the altare for a swete sauoure vnto the LORDE. And so shal the prest make an attonemet for him, and it shal be forgeuen him.
{4:32} But yf he brynge a lambe for a synofferynge, then let him brynge a female without blemysh,
{4:33} and laye his hande vpon the heade of the synofferynge, & kyll it for a synofferynge, in the place where the burntofferynges are slayne.
{4:34} And the prest shal take of ye bloude wt his fynger, & put it vpon the hornes of the altare of burntofferynges, & poure all the bloude vpon the botome of the altare.
{4:35} But all ye fatt therof shall he take fro it, like as he dyd the fat of the lambe of the healthofferynge, & shal burne it vpon ye altare for the LORDES sacrifice. And so ye prest shal make an attonement for the synne that he hath done, and it shalbe forgeuen him.
{5:1} Whan a soule synneth, yt he heare a cursynge, and is wytnesse therof, or hath sene it, or knowne it, & telleth it not, he is giltie of a trespace.
{5:2} Or whan a soule toucheth eny vncleane thige, whether it be ye carion of an vncleane beast, or catell, or worme, & was not awarre of it, he is vncleane, and hath offended.
{5:3} Or whan he toucheth an vncleane man (what vnclennesse so euer a man is defyled withall) & was not awarre of it, & afterwarde cometh to ye knowlege therof, ye same hath offended.
{5:4} Or whan a soule sweareth, so yt he pronounceth wt his mouth to do euell or good (what so euer it be that a man pronounceth wt an ooth) & was not awarre of it, & afterwarde cometh to the knowlege therof, he hath offended in one of these.
{5:5} Now whan it so is, yt he hath offended in one of these, & is enfourmed therof, what he hath synned,
{5:6} he shal bringe vnto ye LORDE for his trespace of this his synne yt he hath done, a female from the flocke, either a yewe or a she goate for a synofferynge: so shal the prest make an attonement for him concernynge his synne.
{5:7} But yf he be not able to brynge a shepe, then let him brynge vnto ye LORDE for his offence that he hath done, two turtill doues or two yonge pigeons: one for a synofferynge, the other for a burntofferynge,
{5:8} and brynge them to the prest: Which shall make the first of a synofferynge, and fyrst wringe the neck of it, so that he plucke it not cleane of,
{5:9} and sprenkle with the bloude vpo the sydes of the altare, and let the resydue of the bloude blede out vpon the botome of the altare: This is the synofferynge.
{5:10} As for the other, he shal make it a burntofferynge, after the maner therof. And thus shall the prest make an attonement for him concernynge the synne that he hath done, & it shalbe forgeuen him.
{5:11} But yf he be not able to brynge two turtill doues or two yonge pigeons, then let him brynge his offerynge for his synne, a tenth deale of an Epha of fyne floure for a synofferynge. But he shall put no oyle theron, ner laye frankecense vpon it, for it is a synofferynge.
{5:12} And he shal brynge it vnto the prest, & ye prest shal take his hadfull of it for a remembraunce, and burne it vpon the altare for an offerynge vnto the LORDE. This is a synofferinge.
{5:13} And so shal the prest make an attoment for him, concernynge his synne that he hath done, & it shalbe forgeuen him. And the remnaunt shall be the prestes, like a meatofferynge.
{5:14} And the LORDE spake vnto Moses, & sayde:
{5:15} Yf a soule trespace, so yt thorow ignorauce he offendeth in any thinge yt is halowed vnto the LORDE, he shal brynge his trespaceofferinge vnto the LORDE, euen a ramme from ye flocke without blemysh, worth two Sycles of syluer, after the Sycle of the Sanctuary, for a trespace offerynge:
{5:16} and loke what he hath offended in the halowed thinge, he shall make restitucion, & geue the fifth parte more therto. And he shal delyuer it vnto ye prest, which shall make an attonement for him wt the ramme of the trespace offeringe, & it shalbe forgeuen him.
{5:17} Whan a soule synneth, and doth ought agaynst eny comaundement of the LORDE, yt he shulde not do, & is infourmed therof, he hath trespased, & is giltie of the synne.
{5:18} And he shall brynge from the flocke a ramme wt out blemysh (that is worth a trespaceofferinge) vnto the prest, which shal make an attonement for him concernynge his ignoraunce which he dyd, and was not awarre, and it shalbe forgeuen him.
{5:19} This is the trespaceofferynge, because he trespaced agaynst the LORDE.
{6:1} And ye LORDE talked with Moses, and sayde:
{6:2} Whan a soule synneth, & trespaceth agaynst the LORDE, so that he denyeth vnto his neghboure that which he gaue him to kepe, or that was put vnder his hande, or that he hath violently taken awaye, or gotten vnrighteously,
{6:3} or founde that was lost, and denyeth it with a false ooth, what so euer it be, wherin a man synneth agaynst his neghboure. Now whan it commeth so to passe,
{6:4} that he synneth after this maner, & trespaceth, he shal restore agayne that he toke violently awaye, or gat wrongeously, or that was geuen him to kepe, or that he hath founde,
{6:5} or what so euer it be aboute ye which he hath sworne falsely, he shal restore it againe whole alltogether, and geue the fifth parte more therto, euen to him that it belonged vnto, the same daye that he geueth his trespace offerynge.
{6:6} But for his trespace he shall brynge for the LORDE (euen vnto the prest) a ramme from the flocke without blemysh, that is worth a trespace offerynge.
{6:7} Then shall the prest make an attonement for him before the LORDE, and all that he hath synned in, shalbe forgeuen him.
{6:8} And the LORDE spake vnto Moses, and sayde:
{6:9} Commaunde Aaron and his sonnes, and saye: This is the lawe of the burntofferynge. The burntofferynge shall burne vpon the altare all night vntyll the mornynge. But the fyre of the altare onely shal burne theron.
{6:10} And ye prest shal put on his lynen albe, and his lyuen breches vpon his flesh, and shal take vp the asshes, that the fyre of the burntofferynge vpon the altare hath made, and shall poure them besyde the altare.
{6:11} Then shall he put of his rayment, and put on other rayment, and cary out the asshes without the hoost, into a cleane place.
{6:12} The fyre vpon the altare shal burne, and neuer go out. The prest shal kyndle wod theron euery mornynge, and dresse the burntofferynge vpon it, and burne the fat of the deedofferynges theron.
{6:13} The fyre shall euer burne vpon the altare, and neuer go out.
{6:14} And this is the lawe of the meatofferynge, which Aarons sonnes shall offre before the LORDE vpon the altare.
{6:15} One of them shall Heue his handfull of fyne floure of ye meatofferynge, and of the oyle, and all the frankencense that lyeth vpon the meatofferynge, and shall burne it vpon the altare for a swete sauoure a remembraunce vnto the LORDE.
{6:16} As for the remnaunt, Aaron and his sonnes shal eate it, and vnleuended shal they eate it in the holy place, namely, in the courte of the Tabernacle of witnesse.
{6:17} With leue shal they not bake their porcion, which I haue geuen them of my offerynges. It shalbe vnto them most holy, as the synofferynge and trespace offerynge.
{6:18} All the males amonge the children of Aaron shall eate of it. Let this be a perpetuall lawe for youre posterities in the sacrifices of the LORDE. No man shall touch it, excepte he be consecrated.
{6:19} And the LORDE spake vnto Moses, and sayde:
{6:20} This shalbe the offerynge of Aaron and of his sonnes, which they shall offre vnto the LORDE in the daie of their anoyntinge. The tenth parte of an Epha of fyne floure for a meatofferynge daylie, the one half parte in the mornynge, the other half parte at euen.
{6:21} In the panne with oyle shall thou make it, and brynge it fryed, and in peces shalt thou offer it for the swete sauoure of the LORDE.
{6:22} And the prest which amonge his sonnes shalbe anoynted in his steade, shall do this. This is a perpetuall dewtye vnto the LORDE. It shal be burnt alltogether:
{6:23} for all the meatofferynges of the prest shalbe consumed with the fyre, and not be eaten.
{6:24} And ye LORDE talked with Moses, and sayde:
{6:25} Speake vnto Aaron and his sonnes, and saye: This is the lawe of the synofferynge: In the place where thou slayest ye bunrtofferynge, shalt thou slaye the synofferynge also before the LORDE. This is most holy.
{6:26} The prest that offereth the synofferynge, shal eate it in the holy place, in the courte of ye Tabernacle of wytnesse.
{6:27} No man shal touch ye flesh therof, excepte he be halowed. And yf eny garment be sprenkled with the bloude of it, it shalbe washe in the holy place.
{6:28} And the earthe pot that it is sodden in, shalbe broken. But yf it be a brasen pot, it shalbe scoured, and resed with water.
{6:29} All ye males amonge the prestes shall eate therof, for it is most holy.
{6:30} Notwithstondinge all ye synofferynge whose bloude is brought in to the Tabernacle of wytnesse to make an attonement, shall not be eaten, but burnt with fyre.
{7:1} And this is the lawe of the trespace-offerynge, and it shal be most holy.
{7:2} In the place where the burntofferynge is slayne, shall the trespaceofferynge be slayne also, & there shall of his bloude be sprenkled rounde aboute vpon the altare.
{7:3} And all his fat shalbe offered: the rompe and the fat yt couereth the bowels,
{7:4} the two kydneys with the fat yt is theron vpon the loynes, and the net on the leuer vpon the kydneys also.
{7:5} And the prest shal burne it vpon the altare for an offerynge vnto the LORDE. This is a trespace offerynge.
{7:6} All the males amonge the prestes shal eate it in the holy place, for it is most holy:
{7:7} euen as the synofferynge, so shall the trespace offerynge be also, they shall both haue one lawe: and it shal be the prestes, that reconcyleth ther wt.
{7:8} Loke which prest offereth eny mans burntofforynge, the skynne of the same burntoffrynge that he hath offered, shalbe his.
{7:9} And euery meatofferynge that is baken in the ouen, rosted vpon the gredyron, or fryed in the panne, shal be the prestes yt offereth it.
{7:10} And euery meatofferynge yt is myngled with oyle, or drye, shal belonge vnto all Aaron sonnes, vnto one as well as another.
{7:11} And this is ye lawe of the healthofferinge, that is offered vnto the LORDE,
{7:12} Yf they wyll offre a sacrifice of thankesgeuynge, then shal they offre vnleueded cakes megled with oyle, and swete wafers straked ouer with oyle, and fryed cakes of fyne floure mengled with oyle.
{7:13} This offerynge also shall they brynge vpon a cake of leuended bred, to the thankofferynge of his healthofferynge:
{7:14} and of them all he shall offre one for an Heueofferynge vnto the LORDE. And it shalbe the prestes, that sprenkleth the bloude of the healthofferynge.
{7:15} And the flesh of the thankofferynge in his healthofferynges, shalbe eaten the same daye that it is offred, and there shall nothinge be left ouer vntyll the mornynge.
{7:16} And whether it be a vowe or a fre wylofferynge, it shalbe eaten the same daye that it is offred: yf ought be left ouer vntyll the mornynge, yet maye it be eaten.
{7:17} But loke what remayneth vnto ye thirde daye of the flesh that is offred, it shalbe brent with the fyre.
{7:18} And yf eny man vpon the thirde daie eate of ye offred flesh of his healthofferynge, he shall not be accepted that offred it. Nether shall it be rekened vnto him, but it shalbe refused. And loke which soule eateth therof, the same is giltie of a mysdede.
{7:19} And the flesh that toucheth eny vncleane thinge, shal not be eaten, but burnt with the fyre. But who so euer is cleane of body, shal eate of the flesh:
{7:20} and the soule that eateth of ye flesh of ye healthofferynge which belongeth vnto the LORDE, his vnclennes be vpon him, and he shalbe roted out from amonge his people.
{7:21} And whan a soule toucheth eny vncleane thinge, whether it be an vncleane man, catell, or eny other abhominacion that is, and eateth of the flesh of the burntofferynge, that belongeth vnto the LORDE, the same shalbe roted out from amonge his people.
{7:22} And the LORDE talketh with Moses, and sayde:
{7:23} Speake vnto the children of Israel, & saye: Ye shall eate no fat of oxen, lambes, and goates:
{7:24} neuerthelesse the fat of it that dyeth alone, and of soch as is torne of wylde beastes, that maye ye occupye to all maner of vses, but ye shall not eate it.
{7:25} For who so euer eateth the fat of ye beest that is geuen vnto the LORDE for an offerynge, the same soule shalbe roted out from his people.
{7:26} Morouer, ye shall eate no bloude, nether of catell, ner of foules, where so euer ye dwell.
{7:27} What soule eateth eny bloude, the same shall be roted out from his people.
{7:28} And the LORDE talked with Moses, and sayde:
{7:29} Speake vnto the children of Israel, and saye: Who so wyll offre his healthofferynge vnto the LORDE, the same shall also brynge with all, that belongeth vnto ye healthofferynge for the LORDE.
{7:30} But he shall brynge it with his hande for the offerynge of the LORDE: namely the fat vpon the brest shall he brynge, with the brest, to be a Waueofferynge before the LORDE.
{7:31} And the prest shall burne the fat vpon the altare, and the brest shalbe Aarons and his sonnes.
{7:32} And the right shulder shal they geue vnto the prest for a gift of their healthofferynges.
{7:33} And loke which of Aarons sonnes offreth the bloude of the healthofferynges, and the fat, the same shall haue the right shulder for his parte.
{7:34} For the Wauebrest and the Heueshulder haue I taken of the children of Israel, and of their healthofferynges, and haue geuen them vnto Aaron the prest and vnto his sonnes for a perpetuall dewtye.
{7:35} This is the anoyntinge of Aaron and of his sonnes, of the offerynges of the LORDE, in the daye wha Moses presented them to be prestes vnto the LORDE,
{7:36} what tyme as the LORDE commaunded (in the daye whan he anoynted them) to be geuen them of the children of Israel for a perpetuall dewtye, and vnto all their posterities.
{7:37} And this is the lawe of the burntofferynge, of the meatofferynge, of the synofferynge, of the trespace offerynge, of the offerynge of consecracion, and of the healthofferynges,
{7:38} which the LORDE commaunded Moses vpon mount Sinai, in the daye whan he gaue him in commaudement vnto the children of Israel, to offre their offerynges vnto ye LORDE in the wyldernesse of Sinai.
{8:1} And the LORDE spake vnto Moses, & sayde:
{8:2} Take Aaron and his sonnes wt him, & their vestimentes, & the anoyntinge oyle, and a bullocke for a synofferynge, two rammes, and a maunde with vnleuended bred,
{8:3} and call the whole congregacion together, before the dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse.
{8:4} Moses dyd as the LORDE commaunded him, and gathered the congregacion together vnto the dore of ye Tabernacle of wytnesse,
{8:5} and sayde vnto them: This is it, that the LORDE hath commaunded to do.
{8:6} And he toke Aaron and his sonnes, and wasshed them with water,
{8:7} and put the albe vpo him, and girde him with the girdell, and put vpon him the yalowe tunycle, and put the ouerbody cote vpon him, and girde him vpon the ouerbody cote,
{8:8} & put the brestlappe theron, and in ye brestlappe light and perfectnesse:
{8:9} And set the myter vpon his heade. And vpon the myter euen aboue his fore heade, put he a plate of golde on the holy crowne: as ye LORDE comaunded Moses.
{8:10} And Moses toke the anoyntinge oyle, & anoynted the Habitacion, and all that was therin, and consecrated it,
{8:11} and sprenkled therwith seue tymes vpon the altare, and anoynted the altare with all his vessels, the lauer with his fote, that it might be consecrated:
{8:12} and poured the anoyntinge oyle vpon Aarons heade, and anoynted him, yt he might be consecrated.
{8:13} And he brought Aarons sonnes, and put albes vpon them, and girde them with the girdle, and put bonettes vpon their heades, as the LORDE commaunded him.
{8:14} And he caused bringe a bullocke for a synoffrynge. And Aaron with his sonnes layed their handes vpon his heade,
{8:15} and then was he slayne. And Moses toke of the bloude, & put it vpon the homes of the altare rounde aboute with his fynger, and purified the altare, and poured the bloude vpon the botome of the altare, and consecrated it, that he might reconcyle it.
{8:16} And toke all the fat vpo the bowels, the nett vpon the leuer, and the two kydneys with the fat theron, and burned it vpon the altare.
{8:17} But the bullocke wt his skynne, flesh, & donge, burned he with fyre without the hoost, as the LORDE commaunded him.
{8:18} And he brought a ramme for a burntofferynge. And Aaron wt his sonnes layed their handes vpon his heade,
{8:19} & then was he slayne. And Moses sprenkled of ye bloude vpon the altare rounde aboute,
{8:20} hewed the ramme in peces, and burnt the heade, the peces, and the fatt.
{8:21} And wasshed the bowels and the legges with water, and so burnt ye whole ramme vpo the altare. This was a bruntofferynge for a swete sauoure, euen a sacrifice vnto the LORDE, as the LORDE commaunded him.
{8:22} He brought also the other ramme of the offerynge of the consecracion. And Aaron with his sonnes layed their hades vpon his heade,
{8:23} and then was it slayne. And Moses toke of his bloude, and put it vpon the typpe of Aarons right eare, and vpon the thombe of his right hande, and vpon the greate too of his right fote.
{8:24} And he brought Aarons sonnes, and put of the bloude vpon the typpe of the right eare of them, and vpon ye thombes of their righte handes, and vpon the greate toes of their righte fete, and poured the resydue of the bloude vpon the altare rounde aboute.
{8:25} And he toke the fat and the rompe, and all the fat vpon the bowels, and the nett vpon the leuer, the two kydneys with the fat theron, and the righte shulder.
{8:26} And out of the maunde of vnleuended bred before the LORDE, he toke an vnleueded cake, and a cake of oyled bred, and a wafer, and layed them vpo the fat, and vpon the right shulder,
{8:27} and put alltogether vpon the handes of Aaron and of his sonnes, and waued it for a Waueofferynge before the LORDE.
{8:28} And afterwarde toke he all agayne from their hondes, and burned them on the altare, euen vpon the burntofferinge: for it is an offerynge of consecracion for a swete sauoure, euen a sacrifice vnto ye LORDE.
{8:29} And Moses toke the brest, and waued it a Waueofferynge before the LORDE, of the ramme of the offerynge of consecracion: the same was Moses parte, as the LORDE commaunded Moses.
{8:30} And Moses toke of ye anoyntinge oyle, & of the bloude vpon the altare, & sprenkled it vpon Aaron & his vestimentes, vpon his sonnes & vpon their vestimentes, and so cosecrated Aaron & his vestimentes, his sonnes and their vestimentes with him.
{8:31} And he sayde vnto Aaron & his sonnes: Seeth ye flesh before the dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse, & there eate it, & the bred in ye maunde of the cosecracion offeringes, as it is comaunded me, & sayde: Aaron & his sonnes shall eate it.
{8:32} As for yt which remayneth of the flesh & bred, ye shal burne it with fyre.
{8:33} And in seue dayes shall ye not departe from ye dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse, vntyll the daye, yt the dayes of yor consecracion offerynges be at an ende: for seue dayes must yor handes be consecrated,
{8:34} as it is come to passe this daye: The LORDE hath comaunded to do it, that ye might be reconcyled.
{8:35} And ye shal tary before the Tabernacle of wytnesse daye and night seuen dayes longe, & shal kepe ye watch of ye LORDE, that ye dye not, for thus am I comaunded.
{8:36} And Aaron with his sonnes dyd all, that ye LORDE commaunded by Moses.
{9:1} And vpon the eight daye Moses called Aaron and his sonnes, and the Elders in Israel,
{9:2} and sayde vnto Aaron: Take vnto the a yonge calfe for a synofferinge, and a ramme for a burntofferynge, both without blemysh, and brynge them before the LORDE,
{9:3} and speake vnto the children of Israel, and saye: Take an he goate for a synofferynge: and a calf, and a shepe, both of a yeare olde, and without blemysh for a burntofferynge:
{9:4} and an oxe and a ramme for an healthofferynge, that we maye offre before the LORDE: and a meatofferynge myngled with oyle. For to daye shal the LORDE appeare vnto you.
{9:5} And they toke what Moses commaunded before ye dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse, and the whole cogregacion came nye, and stode before the LORDE.
{9:6} Then sayde Moses: This is it, which the LORDE commaunded that ye shulde do, and then shall the glory of ye LORDE appeare vnto you.
{9:7} And Moses sayde vnto Aaron: Go vnto ye altare, and offre thy synofferynge and thy burntofferynge, and make an attonemet for the and for the people. Then offre the peoples offerynge, and reconcyle them also, as the LORDE hath commaunded.
{9:8} And Aaron wente vnto the altare, and slawe ye calfe for his synofferynge,
{9:9} & his sonnes brought the bloude vnto him. And he dypte his fynger in the bloude, and put it vpon the hornes of the altare, and poured ye bloude vpon ye botome of the altare.
{9:10} As for the fat and the kydneys & the net vpon the leuer of the synofferynge, he burnt the vpon the altare, as the LORDE comaunded Moses.
{9:11} The flesh also and the hyde burnt he wt fyre without the hoost.
{9:12} Afterwarde he slewe the burntofferinge, and Aarons sonnes brought the bloude vnto him, & he sprenkled it rounde aboute vpon the altare.
{9:13} And they brought him the burntofferynge in peces, & the heade: & he burnt it vpon the altare.
{9:14} And he washed the bowels and the legges, and burnt them aboue vpon the burntofferynge on the altare.
{9:15} Then brought he the offerynge of the people, and toke the goate, that synofferynge of the people, and slewe it, and made a synofferynge therof, as of the fyrst.
{9:16} And brought the burntofferynge, and dyd as the lawe is:
{9:17} and brought the meatofferynge, and toke his handfull, and burnt it vpon the altare, besyde the burntofferinge of the mornynge.
{9:18} Afterwarde slewe he the oxe and the ramme for the healthofferynge of the people. And his sonnes brought him the bloude, which he sprenkled vpon the altare rounde aboute.
{9:19} But the fat of the oxe & of the ramme, the rompe, and the fat that couereth the bowels, & the kydneyes, & the net vpon the leuer,
{9:20} all soch fat laied they vpon the brest, and burnt the fat vpon the altare.
{9:21} But the brest and the right shulder waued Aaron for a Waueofferynge before the LORDE, as the LORDE commaunded Moses.
{9:22} And Aaron lift vp his hade ouer the people, and blessed them, and came downe from the worke of the synofferynge, burntofferynge, and healthofferynge.
{9:23} And Moses and Aaron wente in to the Tabernacle of wytnesse. And whan they came out agayne, they blessed the people. Then appeared the glory of the LORDE vnto all the people.
{9:24} For there came a fyre from the LORDE, and vpon the altare it consumed the burntofferynge and the fat. Whan all the people sawe that, they reioysed, and fell vpon their faces.
{10:1} And ye sonnes of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, toke ether of the his censoure, & put fyre therin, & layed incense vpon it, and brought straunge fyre before the LORDE, which he commauded them not.
{10:2} Then wente there out a fyre from ye LORDE, and consumed them, so that they dyed before the LORDE.
{10:3} Then sayde Moses vnto Aaron: This is it, that the LORDE sayde: I wil be sanctified vpo them that come nye me, and before all the people wil I be glorified. And Aaron helde his peace.
{10:4} Moses called Misael and Elzaphan the sonnes of Vsiel Aarons vncle, and sayde vnto them: Go to, and cary youre brethren out of the Sanctuary, without the hoost.
{10:5} And they wente, and caried them forth in their albes without the hoost, as Moses sayde.
{10:6} Then sayde Moses vnto Aaron, & to his sonnes Eleasar and Ithamar: Ye shall not vncouer youre heades, ner rente yor clothes, that ye dye not, and the wrath come vpon the whole congregacion: Let youre brethre of the whole house of Israel bewepe this burnynge, which the LORDE hath done.
{10:7} As for you, ye shall not go out from the dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse, lest ye dye: for the anoyntinge oyle of the LORDE is vpon you. And they dyd as Moses sayde.
{10:8} The LORDE spake vnto Aaron, & sayde:
{10:9} Thou & thy sonnes wt the shal drynke no wyne ner stronge drynke, whan ye go in to the Tabernacle of wytnesse: that ye dye not. Let this be a perpetuall lawe vnto all yor posterities:
{10:10} yt ye maye haue knowlege to discerne, what is holy and vnholy, what is cleane & vncleane:
{10:11} & that ye maye teach the children of Israel all the lawes, which the LORDE hath spoken vnto you by Moses.
{10:12} And Moses sayde vnto Aaron, and vnto Eleasar and Ithamar his sonnes that were left: Take the remnaunt of the meatofferynge in the sacrifices of ye LORDE, and eate it without leuen besyde the altare, for it is most holy,
{10:13} euen in the holy place shal ye eate it. For it is thy dutye and thy sonnes dutye in the sacrifices of the LORDE: for thus am I commaunded.
{10:14} But the Wauebrest and the Heueshulder shalt thou eate, and thy sonnes and thy doughters with the in a cleane place. For this dutye is geuen vnto the and thy children in the deedofferynges of the children of Israel.
{10:15} For the Heueshulder and the Wauebrest to the offerynges of the fat, shalbe brought in, that they maye be waued for a Waueofferinge before the LORDE. Therfore is it thine and thy childrens for a perpetuall dutye, as the LORDE commaunded.
{10:16} And Moses sought for the goate of the synofferynge, and founde it burnt. And he was angrie at Eleasar and Ithamar ye sonnes of Aaron, which were left alyue, and sayde:
{10:17} Wherfore haue ye not eaten the synofferynge in the holy place? for it is most holy, & he hath geuen it you, that ye might beare ye synne of the cogregacion, to make agremet for them before the LORDE.
{10:18} Beholde, the bloude of it came not in to the Sanctuary: Ye shulde haue eaten it in the Sanctuary, as I was commaunded.
{10:19} Aaron sayde vnto Moses: Beholde, this daye haue they offred their synofferynge & their burntofferynge before ye LORDE. And it is chaunsed me after this maner. And shulde I eate of the synofferynge to daye, & be mery before the LORDE?
{10:20} Whan Moses herde that, he was content.
{11:1} And ye LORDE talked wt Moses & Aaron & sayde:
{11:2} Speake vnto ye childre of Israel, and saye: These are the beestes which ye shal eate amoge all ye beestes vpo earth:
{11:3} What so euer hath hoffe, & deuydeth it in to two clawes, & cheweth cud amonge the beestes, that shal ye eate.
{11:4} But loke what cheweth cud & hath hoffe, & deuydeth it not, as the Camell, the same is vncleane vnto you, & ye shal not eate it.
{11:5} The Conyes chewe cud, but they deuyde not the hoffe in to two clawes, therfore are they vncleane vnto you.
{11:6} The Hare cheweth cud also, but deuydeth not ye hoffe in to two clawes, therfore is he vncleane vnto you.
{11:7} And the Swyne deuydeth ye hoffe in to two clawes, but cheweth not the cud, therfore is it vncleane vnto you.
{11:8} Of the flesh of these shall ye not eate, ner touch their carcases, for they are vncleane vnto you.
{11:9} These shall ye eate of all that are in the waters: What so euer hath fynnes and scales in the waters, sees & ryuers, that shal ye eate.
{11:10} But what so euer hath not fynnes and scales in the sees and ryuers, amonge all yt moue in the waters, & of all that lyue in the waters, it shalbe an abhominacion vnto you,
{11:11} so that ye eate not of their flesh, and that ye abhorre their carcases.
{11:12} For all that haue not fynnes & scales in the waters, shall ye abhorre.
{11:13} And these shal ye abhorre amonge ye foules, so that ye eate them not: The Aegle, the Goshauke, the Cormoraunte,
{11:14} the Vultur, ye Ryce, and all his kynde,
{11:15} and all Rauens wt their kynde:
{11:16} the Estrich, ye Nightcrow, the Cocow, the Sparow hauke with his kynde,
{11:17} the litle Oule, the Storke, the greate Oule,
{11:18} ye Backe, the Pellycane, the Swanne, the Pye,
{11:19} the Heron, ye Iaye with his kynde, the Lapwynge, and ye Swalowe.
{11:20} And whatsoeuer crepeth amonge the foules, and goeth vpon foure fete, shalbe an abhominacio vnto you.
{11:21} Yet these shal ye eate of the foules that crepe and go vpon foure fete: euen those that haue no knyes aboue vpon ye legges, to hoppe withall vpon earth.
{11:22} Of these maye ye eate, as there is the Arbe with his kynde, and the Selaam with his kynde, & the Hargol with his kynde, & the Hagab wt his kynde.
{11:23} But what so euer els hath foure fete amonge the foules, it shalbe an abhominacion vnto you,
{11:24} and ye shal take it for vncleane. Who so euer toucheth the carcase of soch, shall be vncleane vntill ye euen:
{11:25} and who so euer beareth the carcase of eny of these, shall wash his clothes, and shalbe vncleane vntyll the euen.
{11:26} Therfore euery beest that hath hoffe, and deuydeth it not in to two clawes, & cheweth not cud, shalbe vncleane vnto you. Who so euer toucheth soch, shalbe vncleane.
{11:27} And what so euer goeth vpon handes amonge ye beestes that go vpon foure fete, shalbe vncleane vnto you. Who so euer toucheth the carcases of the, shalbe vncleane vntyll euen.
{11:28} And he yt beareth their carcase, shall wash his clothes, and be vncleane vntyll the eue: For soch are vncleane vnto you.
{11:29} These shalbe vncleane vnto you also, amonge the beestes that crepe vpon earth: ye Wesell, the Mouse, the Tode, euery one with his kynde,
{11:30} the Hedgehogge, the Stellio, the Lacerte, the Snale, and the Moule,
{11:31} these are vncleane vnto you amonge all that crepe. Who so euer toucheth the deed carcase of the, shalbe vncleane vntyll the euen.
{11:32} And what so euer eny soch deed carcase falleth vpon, it shalbe vncleane, what so euer vessell of wodd it be, or rayment, or skynne, or bagge. And euery vessell that eny thinge is occupyed with all, shalbe put in the water, and is vncleane vntyll the euen, and then shal it be cleane.
{11:33} All maner of earthen vessell that eny soch carcase falleth in to, shal all be vncleane that therin is, & ye shal breake it.
{11:34} All meate which is eate, that eny soch water commeth in to, is vncleane: & all maner of drynke that is dronke in all maner of soch vessell, is vncleane.
{11:35} And what so euer eny soch carcase falleth vpo, it shalbe vncleane, whether it be ouen or kettell, so shal it be broke, for it is vncleane, and shalbe vncleane vnto you:
{11:36} Neuertheles the fountaynes, welles, & poundes of water are cleane. But who so euer toucheth their carcases, is vncleane.
{11:37} And though the deed carcase of eny soch fell vpon the sede that is sowne, yet is it cleane.
{11:38} But whan there is water poured vpon the sede, and afterwarde eny soch deed carcase falleth theron, then shall it be vncleane vnto you.
{11:39} Whan a beest dyeth that ye maye eate, he that toucheth the deed carcase therof, is vncleane vntyll euen.
{11:40} Who so eateth of eny soch carcase, shall wash his clothes, and be vncleane vntyll the euen. Likewyse he that beareth eny soch carcase, shal wash his clothes, and be vncleane vntyll the euen.
{11:41} What so euer crepeth vpon earth, shall be an abhominacion vnto you, and shall not be eaten.
{11:42} And what so euer crepeth vpon ye bely, or all that goeth vpon foure or mo fete, amoge all that crepeth vpon earth, shall ye not eate, for it shalbe an abhominacion vnto you.
{11:43} Make not youre soules abhominable, and defyle you not in them, to stayne youre selues:
{11:44} for I am the LORDE youre God. Therfore shal ye sanctifie youre selues, that ye maye be holy, for I am holy. And ye shal not defyle youre selues on eny maner of crepynge beest, that crepeth vpon earth:
{11:45} for I am the LORDE, which brought you out of the londe of Egipte, that I might be youre God: therfore shal ye be holy, for I am holy.
{11:46} This is the lawe ouer ye beestes and foules, & all maner of soules of crepynge beestes in the waters, and all maner of soules yt crepe vpon earth:
{11:47} that ye maie knowe to discerne what is vncleane & cleane, and what maner of beestes are to be eaten, and which are not to be eaten.
{12:1} And the LORDE talked with Moses, and sayde:
{12:2} Speake vnto the children of Israel, and saye: Whan a woman hath conceaued, and beareth a manchilde, she shalbe vncleane seuen dayes, so longe as she suffreth hir disease,
{12:3} and in ye eight daye shal ye flesh of his foreskynne be cut awaie.
{12:4} And she shal byde at home thre and thirtie dayes in ye bloude of hir purifienge: she shal touch no holy thinge, ner come in to ye Sactuary, tyll the daies of hir purifienge be out.
{12:5} But yf she beare a maydechilde, the shal she be vncleane two wekes, so longe as she suffreth hir disease, and sixe and thre score daies shall she byde at home in the bloude of hir purifienge.
{12:6} And whan the dayes of hir purifienge are out, for the sonne or for the doughter, she shal brynge a lambe of one yeare olde for a burntofferynge, and a yonge pigeon or a turtill doue for a synofferynge to the dore of ye Tabernacle of wytnesse vnto ye prest,
{12:7} which shal offre it before the LORDE, and make an attonemet for her, and so shal she be clensed from hir bloudyssue. This is the lawe for her that beareth a manchilde or mayde childe.
{12:8} But yf she be not able to bringe a shepe, then let hir take two turtill doues, or two yonge pigeons, the one for a burntofferynge, the other for a synofferynge, then shall the prest make an attonement for her, so that she shal be cleane.
{13:1} And ye LORDE spake vnto Moses & Aaron, & sayde:
{13:2} Whan there ryseth vp eny thinge in the skynne of a mans flesh, whether it be a scabbe or a glistrynge whyte (as though there wolde be a leprosy in ye skynne of his flesh) he shal be brought vnto Aaron the prest, or to one of his sonnes amonge ye prestes.
{13:3} And whan the prest seyth the plage vpon the skynne of the flesh, that the hayres are turned to whyte, and it seme deper in that place then the other skynne of his flesh, then is it surely a leprosy, therfore shal the prest loke vpon him, and iudge him vncleane.
{13:4} But whan there is eny whyte plecke in the skynne of his flesh, and yet seme no deper then the other skynne of the flesh, and the hayres be not turned to whyte, the shal the prest shut him vp seuen dayes,
{13:5} and on ye seuenth daye loke vpon him: yf the plage seme vnto him as afore, & hath frett no deper in the skynne, then shall the prest shut him vp yet seuen dayes mo.
{13:6} And whan he loketh on him agayne vpon the seuenth daye, and fyndeth, that the plage be darkish, and hath frett no deper in the skynne, the shal he iudge him cleane, for it is but a skyrfe, and he shal wash his clothes, & then is he cleane.
{13:7} But whan the scabbe fretteth farther in the skynne (after that he is sene of the prest, and iudged cleane) and he be now sene of the prest agayne:
{13:8} whan the prest seyth the, yt the scabbe hath frett farther in the skynne, he shal iudge him vncleane, for it is surely a leprosy.
{13:9} Whan a plage of leprosy is vpo a man, he shalbe brought vnto the prest.
{13:10} Whan he seyth and fyndeth, that there is whyte rysen vp in the skynne, and the hayre turned vnto whyte, and there be rawe flesh in the sore,
{13:11} the is it surely an olde leprosy in ye skynne of his flesh, therfore shal the prest iudge him vncleane, and not shut him vp, for he is vncleane allready.
{13:12} But whan the leprosy breaketh out in the skynne, and couereth the whole skynne, from the heade vnto the fote, all that the prest can se,
{13:13} So whan the prest loketh vpon it, and fyndeth, that ye leprosy hath couered all the flesh, he shal iudge him cleane, for so moch as it is turned all in to whyte vpon him, for he is cleane.
{13:14} Notwithstodinge yf there be rawe flesh there, in the daye whan he is loked vpon, the is he vncleane.
{13:15} And whan the prest seyth ye rawe flesh, he shall iudge him vncleane, for he is vncleane, & it is surely a leprosye.
{13:16} But yf the rawe flesh chaunge agayne, and be turned in to whyte, then shall he come vnto the prest.
{13:17} And whan the prest loketh vpon him, and fyndeth, that the plage is turned to whyte, he shall iudge him cleane, for he is cleane.
{13:18} Whan there is a byle in the skynne of eny mans flesh, and healeth agayne,
{13:19} and afterwarde in the same place there aryse vp eny whyte thinge, or a glisterynge whyte somwhat reedish, he shal be sene of the prest.
{13:20} So whan the prest, seyeth, that it appeareth to be lower then the other skynne, and the hayre turned to whyte, then shall he iudge him vncleane, for it is surely a plage of leprosye broken out of the byle.
{13:21} But yf the prest se and fynde, that the hayres are not whyte, and it not lower then the other skynne, and is darkysh, he shal shut him vp seuen dayes.
{13:22} Yf it hath frett farther in the skynne, then shal he iudge him vncleane, for it is surely a plage of leprosye.
{13:23} But yf the glysterynge whyte abyde styll, and freate no farther, the is it but a prynte of the byle, and the prest shal iudge him cleane.
{13:24} Whan the skynne of eny mans flesh is hurt with fyre, and the prynte of the burninge be reedysh or whyte,
{13:25} and the prest loketh vpon him, and fyndeth the hayre turned to whyte vpon the mark of the burnynge, & it apeare deper then the other skynne, the is there surely a leprosy broke out of ye prynte of ye burnynge: therfore shal ye prest iudge hi vncleane, for it is a plage of leprosye.
{13:26} But yf the prest se and fynde, that ye hayre vpon the prynte of the burninge is not turned vnto whyte, & is no lower then the other skynne, and is darkish also, he shall shut him vp seuen dayes.
{13:27} And vpon the seuenth daye he shall loke vpon him: yf it hath frett farther in ye skynne, then shal he iudge him vncleane, for it is a leprosy.
{13:28} But yf it stode styll vpo the mark of the burnynge, and frett no farther in the skynne, and is darkysh, then is it a sore in ye mark of the burnynge, & the prest shal iudge him cleane, for it is but the prynte of the burnynge.
{13:29} Whan a man or woman is skyruye vpon the heade or beerd, and the prest seyth the mark,
{13:30} and fyndeth that it appeareth deper then the other skynne, and the hayre be there golde and thynne, then shal he iudge him vncleane: for it is a skyrfe of leprosy of the heade or of the beerde.
{13:31} But yf the prest se that ye skyrfe apeare no deper the the skynne, and that the hayre is not of a pale coloure, he shall shut him vp seue dayes.
{13:32} And vpo the seuenth daye whan he loketh, and fyndeth, that the skyrfe hath frett no farther, and there be no golden hayre there, and that the skyrfe appeare no deper then the other skynne,
{13:33} then let him be shauen: but so that he shaue not of the scabbe, and the prest shall shut him vp yet seuen dayes moo.
{13:34} And vpon the seueth daye wha he loketh, and fyndeth that the skyrfe hath frett no farther in the skynne, and that it apeareth no deper then the other skynne, then shall the prest iudge him cleane. And he shall wash his clothes, for he is cleane.
{13:35} But yf the scabbe freate farther in the skynne (after yt he is iudged cleane)
{13:36} and the prest loketh, and fyndeth, that ye scabbe hath frett farther in the skynne, then shal he seke nomore for golden hayres, for he is vncleane.
{13:37} Neuerthelesse yf he se that the scabbe stondeth styll, & that pale hayres are there rysen vp, then is ye scabbe hole, and he is cleane, therfore shall ye prest iudge him to be cleane.
{13:38} Wha there is eny glisteringe whyte vpo ye skynne of the flesh of a man or woman,
{13:39} and the prest seyth there that the glisterynge whyte vanysheth: then is it but a whyte scabbe rysen vp in ye skynne, & he is cleane.
{13:40} Whan the hayres fall out of the heade of a man or a woman, so that he is balde, the same is cleane.
{13:41} If they fall out of his fore heade, then is he fore heade balde & cleane.
{13:42} But yf there be a whyte reedish sore in the balde heade, or balde fore heade, then is there a leprosy rysen vp in the balde heade or balde foreheade:
{13:43} therfore shal ye prest loke vpon him. And whan he fyndeth the whyte reedysh sore rysen vp in his balde heade or balde foreheade, then shal ye skynne of the flesh be as leporous,
{13:44} therfore is he a leporous man and vncleane. And the prest shall iudge him vncleane, because of ye same sore vpo his heade.
{13:45} Who so now is leporous, his clothes shalbe rent, and the heade bare, & the lippes moffled, and shall in eny wyse be called vncleane.
{13:46} And as longe as the sore is vpon him, he shal be vncleane, dwell alone, and haue his dwellinge without the hoost.
{13:47} Whan the plage of leprosy is in a cloth, whether it be wollen or lynnen,
{13:48} in the warpe or weft, whether it be lynnen or wollen, or in a skynne, or in eny maner thynge that is made of skynne.
{13:49} And whan ye plage is pale or reedish in the cloth or skynne, either in the warpe or weft, or in eny maner thinge that is made of skynne, the same is surely the plage of leprosy, therfore shall the prest loke vpon it.
{13:50} And whan he seyth the plage, he shal shut it vp seuen dayes.
{13:51} And vpon the seueth daye whan he seyth that ye plage hath frett farther in the cloth, in the warpe or weft, in a skynne or in eny maner thinge that is made of skynne, then is it a fretinge plage of leprosye, and is vncleane
{13:52} .And the cloth shalbe burnt, either warpe or weft, whether it be wollen or lynne, or eny thynge made of skynne, wherin is eny soch plage. For it is a plage of leprosy, and shal be burnt wt fyre.
{13:53} But yf the prest se that the plage hath frete no farther in ye cloth, either in the warpe or weft, or eny thinge made of skynne,
{13:54} then shal he commaunde to wash the thinge that the plage is in, and shall shut it vp other seuen dayes.
{13:55} And whan the prest seyth (after that the plage is wasshen) yt the plage is not chauged before his eyes, and hath frett no farther also, yet is it vncleane, & shalbe burnt wt fyre: for it is depe frete inwarde, and hath made skyrfes.
{13:56} Neuertheles whan the prest seyth that the prynte is vanyshed after the washinge of it, then shall he rente it out of the clothe, and of the skynne, out of the warpe or weft.
{13:57} But yf it appeare eny more in the clothe (either in the warpe, or in the weft) or eny maner thinge made of skynne, then is it a waxinge plage: and with fyre shal it be burnt that eny soch plage is in.
{13:58} As for the cloth, either warpe or weft, or eny maner thynge made of skynne that is wasshe, and the plage be departed from it, it shalbe wasshen once agayne, & then is it cleane.
{13:59} This is the lawe ouer the plage of leprosy in clothes, whether they be wollen or lynne (ether in the warpe or in the weft) and in eny maner of thinge made of sknne, to iudge them cleane or vncleane.
{14:1} And the LORDE spake vnto Moses, and sayde:
{14:2} This is the lawe ouer ye leper, whan he shalbe clensed. He shall come vnto ye prest,
{14:3} and the prest shal go out of the hoost, and loke how the plage of leprosye is healed vpon the leper.
{14:4} And he shal commaunde him that is to be clensed, to take two lyuinge byrdes, which are cleane, and Ceder wodd, and purple woll, and ysope:
{14:5} and shall commaunde the one byrde to be kylled in an earthen vessell ouer sprynginge water.
{14:6} And he shall take the lyuynge byrde with the Ceder wodd, the purple woll, and ysope, and dyppe them in the bloude of the slaine byrde vpon the springynge water,
{14:7} and sprenkle it seuen tymes vpon him that must be clensed from ye leprosy. And so clense him, and let the lyuynge byrde flye at libertye in to the felde.
{14:8} But he that is clensed, shal wash his clothes, and shaue of all his hayre, and bathe him self with water, so is he cleane. Afterwarde let him go in to the hoost, yet shall he tarye without his tent seuen dayes.
{14:9} And vpon the seuenth daye shal he shaue of all ye hayre vpon his heade, vpo his beerde, vpon his browes, so that all the hayre be shauen of, and he shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water, then is he cleane.
{14:10} And vpo the eight daye shal he take two lambes without blemysh, and a shepe of a yeare olde without blemysh, and thre tenth deales of fyne floure for a meatofferynge, myngled with oyle, & a Logg of oyle.
{14:11} The shall the prest presente him that is clensed and these thinges before the LORDE, before the dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse,
{14:12} and shal take ye one lambe, and offre it for trespace offerynge, with the Logg of oyle, & shall waue them, before ye LORDE,
{14:13} and afterwarde slaye the lambe, where the synofferynge and burntofferynge are slayne, namely, in the holy place. For as the synofferynge, so is the trespace offerynge the prestes also, for it is most holy.
{14:14} And the prest shall take of the bloude of the trespace offerynge, and put it vpon the typpe of ye right eare of him that is clesed, and vpon the thombe of his right hande, and vpon the greate too of his right fote.
{14:15} Afterwarde shall he take of the oyle out of the Logg, and poure it in to his awne left hande,
{14:16} and dyppe his right fynger in the oyle that is in his left hande, and sprenkle the oyle with his fynger seuen tymes before the LORDE.
{14:17} As for the remnaunt of the oyle in his hande, he shall put it vpon the typpe of the right eare of him that is clensed, and vpon the thombe of his right hande, & vpon the greate too of his right fote, euen aboue vpon the bloude of the trespace offerynge.
{14:18} But the remnaunt of the oyle in his hande, shall he poure vpon the heade of him that is clensed, and make an attonement for him before the LORDE.
{14:19} And he shall make the synofferynge, and reconcyle him that is clesed, because of his vnclennesse. And afterwarde shall he sleye the burntofferynge,
{14:20} and shal offre it vpon the altare with the meatofferynge, and make an attonement for him, & than is he cleane.
{14:21} But yf he be poore, and getteth not so moch with his hande, then let him take one lambe for a trespaceofferynge to waue it, to make an attonement for him, and a tenth deale of fyne floure myngled with oyle for a meatofferynge, and a Logg of oyle,
{14:22} & two turtyll doues, or two yonge pigeons which he is able to get with his hande, let the one be a synofferynge, the other a burntofferynge:
{14:23} and let him brynge them vpon the eight daye of his clensynge vnto the prest before the dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse before the LORDE.
{14:24} Then shall the prest take the lambe for the synofferynge, and the Logg of oyle, and shall waue them all before the LORDE,
{14:25} and sley the lambe of the trespace offerynge: and take of ye bloude of the same trespaceofferynge, and put it vpon the typpe of the righte eare of him that is clensed, and vpon the thombe of his right hande, and vpon the greate too of his righte fote,
{14:26} and poure of the oyle in to his awne lefte hande,
{14:27} and with his right fynger sprenkle the oyle that is in his left hande, seuen tymes before the LORDE.
{14:28} As for the remnaunt of the oyle in his hande, he shal put it vpon the typpe of the right eare of him that is clensed, and vpon the thombe of his right hande, & vpon the greate too of his right fote, euen aboue vpo ye bloude of ye trespaceofferynge.
{14:29} The other oyle in his hade shal he poure vpo ye heade of him yt is clensed, to make an attonement for him before the LORDE.
{14:30} And afterwarde of the one of the turtill doues or yonge pigeons (acordinge as his handes are able to get)
{14:31} he shal make a synofferynge, of ye other a burntofferynge, with the meatofferynge: and so shal the prest make an attonemet for him that is clensed before the LORDE.
{14:32} Let this be the lawe for the leper, which is not able with his hande to get, that belongeth vnto his clensynge.
{14:33} And the LORDE spake vnto Moses and Aaron, and sayde:
{14:34} Whan ye are come in to the lande of Canaan, which I geue you to possesse: and yf there happen a plage of leprosy in any house of youre possession,
{14:35} then shal he that oweth the house, come and tell the prest, and saye: Me thynke there is as it were a plage of leprosy in my house.
{14:36} Then shal the prest commaunde to rydde all thynge out of the house or euer the prest go in to se ye plage, lest all that is in the house be made vncleane. Afterwarde shall ye prest go in, to se the plage.
{14:37} Now whan he loketh, and fyndeth, yt there be holowe strakes yalowe or reedish in the walles of the house, & they seme to be lower then the wall besyde,
{14:38} then shall he go out at the dore of the house, and shut vp the house for seuen dayes.
{14:39} And vpon the seuenth daye whan he commeth, and seyth that the plage hath fretten farther in the walles of the house,
{14:40} the shall he commaunde to breake out the stones wherin the plage is, & to cast the in a foule place without the cite,
{14:41} & the house to be scraped within rounde aboute, and the dust yt is scraped of, to be poured without ye cite in an vncleane place,
{14:42} & to take other stones, and put them in the place of the other, and to take other playster, and playster the house.
{14:43} Whan the plage then commeth agayne, and breaketh forth in the house, after yt the stones are broke out, the playster scraped of, and the house playsterd of the new,
{14:44} the shal the prest go in: and whan he seyth that the plage hath fretten farther in the house, then is there surely a fretinge leprosy in the house, and it is vncleane:
{14:45} therfore shal the house be broken downe, both the stones, and ye tymber and all the dust of the house, and shal be caried out of the cite in to an vncleane place.
{14:46} And who so goeth into the house, whyle it is shut vp, is vncleane vntyll ye euen.
{14:47} And he yt lyeth therin, or eateth therin, shal wash his clothes.
{14:48} But yf the prest se (wha he goeth in) that this plage hath frett no farther in the house, after that the house is new playsterd, the shal he iudge it to be cleane, for the plage is healed.
{14:49} And to a synofferinge for the house, he shal take two byrdes, Ceder wodd, & purple woll, and ysope,
{14:50} and slaye the one byrde in an erthen vessell vpon sprynginge water,
{14:51} and shall take the Ceder wodd, the purple woll, the ysope, and the lyuinge byrde, & dyppe them in the bloude of the slayne byrde vpon the sprynginge water, and sprenkle the house with all seue tymes:
{14:52} and so shal he purifie the house with the bloude of the byrde, with the springinge water, with the lyuinge byrde, with the Ceder wodd, with the ysope, and with the purple woll.
{14:53} And the lyuynge byrde shall he let flye at libertye out of the towne in to the felde, & make an attonement for the house, and then is it cleane.
{14:54} This is the lawe ouer all maner plage of leprosye & skyrfe,
{14:55} ouer ye leprosye of clothes and of houses,
{14:56} ouer sores, scabbes, and glisterynge whyte,
{14:57} that it maye be knowne, whan eny thinge is vncleane or cleane. This is ye lawe of leprosy.
{15:1} And the LORDE talked with Moses and Aaron, and sayde:
{15:2} Speake to the children of Israel, and saie vnto him: Whan a man hath a runnynge yssue from out of his flesh, ye same is vncleane: but the is he vncleane by the reason of this yssue,
{15:3} whan his flesh is fretten of ye yssue or wounde.
{15:4} Euery bed where on he lyeth, & what so euer he sytteth vpon, shalbe vncleane.
{15:5} And he that toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe him self with water, and be vncleane vntyll the euen.
{15:6} And he yt sytteth where he sat, shal wash his clothes, and bathe him self with water, and be vncleane vntyll the eue.
{15:7} Who so toucheth his flesh, shall wash his clothes, & bathe him self with water, and be vncleane vntyll the euen.
{15:8} Whan he spytteth vpon him that is cleane, ye same shal wash his clothes, and bathe him self with water, & be vncleane vntyll the euen.
{15:9} And the saddell and what so euer he rydeth vpo, shalbe vncleane.
{15:10} And who so euer toucheth eny thinge that hath bene vnder him, shalbe vncleane vntyll the euen. And who so beareth eny soch, shall wash his clothes, and bathe him self with water, and be vncleane vntyll the euen.
{15:11} And whom so euer he toucheth, and washeth not his handes first, the same shal wash his clothes, and bathe him self with water, and be vncleane vntyll the euen.
{15:12} Whan he toucheth an erthen vessell, it shal be broken: but the treen vessell shal be rensed wt water.
{15:13} And wha he is cleane of his yssue, he shal nombre vij. dayes, after yt he is made cleane, & wash his clothes, & bathe him self wt sprynginge water, the is he cleane.
{15:14} And vpon the eight daye shal he take two turtill doues or two yonge pigeos, and brynge them before the LORDE before the dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse, and geue them vnto the prest.
{15:15} And the prest shal make of the one a synofferinge, of the other a burntofferynge, and make an attonement for him before the LORDE, as concernynge his yssue.
{15:16} Whan a mans sede departeth from him in slepe, the same shal bathe all his flesh wt water, and be vncleane vntyll the euen.
{15:17} And all clothes, and euery skynne that is stained with soch sede, shall he wash with water, & be vncleane vntyll the euen.
{15:18} A woman, by whom soch one lyeth, shall bathe hir self wt water, and be vncleane vntyll the euen.
{15:19} Whan a woman hath the bloude yssue of hir flesh, she shalbe put a parte vij. daies in to a sundrie place. Who so euer toucheth her, shal be vncleane vntyll the eue.
{15:20} And all that she lyeth vpon (as longe as she is put aparte) shalbe vncleane.
{15:21} And that she sytteth vpo, shalbe vncleane. And who so euer toucheth hir bed, shal wash his clothes, and bathe him self with water, and be vncleane vntyll the euen.
{15:22} And who so euer toucheth eny maner thinge that she hath sytten vpo, shal wash his clothes, and bathe him self with water, and be vncleane vntyll the euen.
{15:23} And yf a man lye with her (whyle she is put a parte) he shalbe vncleane seuen dayes, and the bed that he laye vpon, shalbe vncleane.
{15:24} KJV: And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean.
{15:25} But whan a woman hath hir bloude yssue a longe season, not onely at the tyme of hir naturall course, but also out of the tyme of hir naturall course, then shall she be vncleane so longe as she hath the yssue: eue as she is at the tyme whan she is put aparte,
{15:26} so shall she be vncleane here also. What so euer she lyeth vpon all the tyme of hir yssue, shalbe as hir bed, whan she is put aparte. And all that she sytteth vpon, shalbe vncleane, as is hir vnclennesse, whan she is put aparte.
{15:27} Who so euer toucheth eny of them, shal be vncleane, and shal wash his clothes, and bathe him self with water, & be vncleane vntyll the euen.
{15:28} But yf she be cleane of hir yssue, the shal she nombre seuen dayes, afterwarde shall she be cleane:
{15:29} and vpon the eight daye shall she take two turtill doues, or two yonge pigeons, and brynge them vnto the prest before the dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse.
{15:30} And the prest shall make of the one a synofferynge, of the other a burntofferynge, and make an attonement for her before the LORDE, as concernynge the yssue of hir vnclenesse.
{15:31} Thus shal ye se that the childre of Israel kepe them selues from their vnclenesse, that they dye not in their vnclennesse, whan they defyle my habitacion, which is amoge you.
{15:32} This is the lawe ouer him that hath a runnynge sore, & him whose sede departeth from him in slepe, so that he is vncleane therof.
{15:33} And ouer her that hath hir bloude yssue, and who so euer hath a runnynge sore, whether it be man or woman, and whan a man lyeth with her that is vncleane.
{16:1} And the LORDE spake vnto Moses (after that Aarons two sonnes were deed, whan they offered before the LORDE) & sayde:
{16:2} Speake vnto Aaron thy brother, yt he go not at all tymes in to ye ynnermer Sanctuary, within the vale before the Mercyseate, which is vpon the Arke, yt he dye not: for I wyll appeare in a cloude vpon ye Mercyseate.
{16:3} But herewithall shal he go in, euen with a yonge bullocke for a synofferynge, and with a ramme for a burntofferynge,
{16:4} and shal put on the holy lynnen albe, and haue lynnen breches vpon his flesh, and gyrde him with a lynne girdell, and haue the lynnen myter vpon his heade.For these are ye holy garmentes: & he shal bathe his flesh with water, & put them on:
{16:5} & of the cogregacion of the childre of Israel he shal take two he goates for a synofferynge, and a ramme for a burntofferynge.
{16:6} And Aaron shal brynge the bullocke his owne synofferynge, and make an attonemet for himself and his house:
{16:7} and afterwarde shall he take the two goates, and present them before the LORDE, euen before the dore of the Tabernacle of witnesse,
{16:8} and shall cast lottes ouer the two goates: the lot of the one goate for the LORDE, and the other for the fre goate.
{16:9} And the goate that ye LORDES lot fell vpon, shal he offre for a synofferynge.
{16:10} But the goate, that the fre goates lot fell vpon, shal he present a lyue before ye LORDE, to make an attonement for him, and to let the fre goate go into ye wyldernes.
{16:11} And so shal he brynge the bullocke of his synofferynge, and make an attonement for him and his housholde, and shal kyll him.
{16:12} And he shall take a censor full of coales from the altare that stondeth before the LORDE, and his handfull of beaten incense, and brynge them in within ye vayle,
{16:13} and put the incense vpon the fyre before ye LORDE, that the cloude of the incense maye couer the Mercyseate, which is vpon the witnesse, that he dye not.
{16:14} And he shall take of the bloude of the bullocke, and sprenkle it with his fynger towarde the Mercyseate on the foresyde. Seuen tymes
{16:15} shall be sprenkle of the bloude thus with his fynger before the Mercyseate. The shal he kyll the goate which is the peoples synofferynge, & brynge in of his bloude within the vayle, & shall do with his bloude, as he dyd with the bloude of the bullocke, and sprenkle therwith also on the foresyde towarde the Mercyseate,
{16:16} and so shal he reconcyle the Sactuary from the vnclennesse of the childre of Israel, and fro their trespaces in all their synnes. Thus shal he do vnto the Tabernacle of wytnesse, which is the habitacion with them amoge their vnclennesses.
{16:17} No man shalbe in the Tabernacle of witnesse, whan he goeth in to make an attonement in the Sactuary, vntyll he go out: and so shall he make an attonement for him self and his house, and for the whole congregacion of Israel.
{16:18} And wha he goeth forth vnto the altare that stondeth before the LORDE, he shal reconcyle it, and shal take of ye bullockes bloude, and of the goates bloude, & put it vpon the hornes of the altare rounde aboute.
{16:19} And with his fynger shal he sprekle of the bloude theron seuen tymes, and halowe it, and consecrate it from the vnclennesse of the children of Israel.
{16:20} And whan he hath made an ende of reconcylinge the Sanctuary, and the Tabernacle of witnesse, and the altare, he shal bringe the lyuynge goate.
{16:21} The shal Aaron laie both his hades vpo ye heade of him, & confesse ouer him all the mysdedes of ye childre of Israel, & all their trespaces in their synnes, & shal laye the vpo ye heade of the goate, & by some man yt is at hande, shal he let him runne in to the wildernes:
{16:22} yt the goate maye so beare all their mysdedes vpon him in to ye wyldernesse, and he shal leaue him in the wyldernesse.
{16:23} And Aaron shal go in to the Tabernacle of witnesse, and put of the lynnen clothes, which he put on wha he wente in to ye Sactuary, and shal leaue them there,
{16:24} and bathe his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his awne rayment. And he shal go forth, and make his burntofferinge, and the burntofferinge of the people, and make an attonement both for himself and for the people,
{16:25} and burne the fat of the synofferynge vpon the altare.
{16:26} But he yt caried out the fre goate, shal wash his clothes, and bathe him self with water, & then come in to the hoost.
{16:27} The bullocke of the synofferynge, and ye goate of the synofferynge (whose bloude was brought in to the Sanctuary to make an attonemet) shalbe caried out of ye hoost, & brent with fyre, both their skynnes, flesh, and donge.
{16:28} And he that burneth them, shal wash his clothes, and bathe him self with water, and then come in to the hoost.
{16:29} And this shalbe a perpetuall lawe vnto you: Vpon the tenth daye of the seuenth moneth shal ye humble youre soules, and do no worke, whether it be one of youre selues, or a straunger amonge you.
{16:30} For in this daye is youre attonemet made, that ye maye be clensed from all youre synnes before the LORDE:
{16:31} therfore shall it be a fre Sabbath vnto you, and ye shal humble youre soules. Let this be a perpetuall lawe.
{16:32} But the prest that is anoynted, and whose hande was fylled to be prest in his fathers steade, shal make this attonement, and shal put on the lynnen clothes, namely the holy vestimetes,
{16:33} so shal he recocyle the holy Sactuary, and the Tabernacle of wytnesse, and the altare, and ye prestes, and all the people of the congregacion.
{16:34} This shal be a perpetuall lawe vnto you, that ye reconcyle ye children of Israel from all their synnes once a yeare. And Moses dyd, as the LORDE commaunded him.
{17:1} And ye LORDE talked with Moses, & sayde:
{17:2} Speake vnto Aaron & his sonnes, & to all ye childre of Israel, & saye vnto them: This is it that ye LORDE hath commaunded:
{17:3} What so euer he be of ye house of Israel, yt kylleth an oxe, or labe, or goate in the hoost, or out of the hoost,
{17:4} and bryngeth it not before the dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse, that it maye be brought vnto the LORDE for an offerynge before the Habitacion of ye LORDE, the same shal be giltie of bloude, as though he had shed bloude, and soch a man shalbe roted out from amonge his people.
{17:5} Therfore shall the children of Israel brynge their offerynges (that they wyll offre vpon the wyde felde) before the LORDE, euen before the dore of the Tabernacle of witnesse, vnto the prest, & there offre their healthofferynges vnto the LORDE.
{17:6} And the prest shal sprenkle the bloude vpon the altare of the LORDE before the dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse, and burne the fat for a swete sauoure vnto the LORDE:
{17:7} and they shall offre their offerynges nomore vnto deuels, with whom they go a whorynge. This shal be a perpetuall lawe vnto them amonge their posterities.
{17:8} Therfore shalt thou saie vnto the: What man so euer he be of the house of Israel, or a straunger also that is amonge you, which offereth a burntofferynge or eny other offerynge,
{17:9} and bringeth it not before the dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse to offre it vnto the LORDE, he shal be roted out from amoge his people.
{17:10} And what man so euer it be (either of the house of Israel, or a straunger amonge you) that eateth eny maner of bloude, agaynst him wyll I set my face, and wil rote him out from amonge his people:
{17:11} for the soule of ye body is in the bloude, and I haue geuen it you for the altare, that youre soules maye be reconcyled ther with:
{17:12} For the bloude that is in the soule maketh attonement. Therfore haue I sayde vnto the children of Israel: No soule amonge you shall eate bloude, no ner eny straunger that dwelleth amonge you.
{17:13} And what man so euer it be amonge you (whether he be of the house of Israel, or a straunger amoge you) that at the huntynge taketh a beest or foule which maye be eaten, he shall poure out the bloude of the same, & couer it with earth:
{17:14} for all flesh lyueth in the bloude. And I haue sayde vnto the children of Israel: Ye shall eate the bloude of no body: for the life of all flesh is in his bloude. Who so euer eateth it, shalbe roted out.
{17:15} And what so euer soule eateth that which dyed alone, or yt was torne of wylde beestes (whether he be one of youre selues or a straunger) the same shal wash his clothes, and bathe himself with water, and be vncleane vntyll the euen, and then is he cleane.
{17:16} But yf he wash not his clothes, nor bathe him self, then shal he beare his synne.
{18:1} And the LORDE talked wt Moses, & saide:
{18:2} Speake vnto the childre of Israel, & saye vnto them: I am the LORDE youre God,
{18:3} Ye shall not do after ye workes of the lande of Egipte, wherin ye dwelt: nether after the doynges of the lande of Canaan, in to the which I will brynge you. Ye shal not walke after their customes,
{18:4} but after my lawes shall ye do, & my statutes shall ye kepe, that ye maye walke therin: for I am the LORDE youre God.
{18:5} Therfore shal ye kepe my statutes and my lawes. For the man that doth the same, shal liue therin, for I am the LORDE.
{18:6} No ma shal come at his nexte kinswoma, to vncouer hir preuytie: for I am ye LORDE.
{18:7} Thou shalt not vncouer ye preuytie of yi father & of yi mother. It is thy mother, therfore shalt thou not vncouer hir preuytie.
{18:8} Thou shalt not vncouer ye preuytie of yi fathers wife, for it is yi fathers preuytie.
{18:9} Thou shalt not vncouer the preuytie of thy sister, which is the doughter of yi father or of yi mother, whether she be borne at home or without.
{18:10} Thou shalt not vncouer the preuytie of thy sonnes doughter, or of thy doughters doughter, for it is thine awne preuytie.
{18:11} Thou shalt not vncouer ye preuytie of yi fathers wiues doughter, which is borne vnto him, and is thy sister.
{18:12} Thou shalt not vncouer the preuytie of thy fathers sister, for it is thy fathers nexte kynswoman.
{18:13} Thou shalt not vncouer the preuytie of thy mothers sister, for it is yi mothers nexte kynswoman.
{18:14} Thou shalt not vncouer the preuytie of thy fathers brother, to take his wife, for she is thine awnte.
{18:15} Thou shalt not vncouer ye preuytie of yi doughter in lawe, for she is yi sonnes wife, therfore shalt thou not vncouer hir preuitie.
{18:16} Thou shalt not vncouer the preuytie of thy brothers wife, for it is thy brothers preuytie.
{18:17} Thou shalt not vncouer the preuytie of thy wife and of hir doughter also, nether shalt thou take hir sonnes doughter or hir doughters doughter, to vncouer their preuyties, for they are hir nexte kynswomen. And it is wickednesse.
{18:18} Thou shalt not take a wife and hir sister also, to vncouer hir preuytie, whyle she is yet alyue.
{18:19} Thou shalt not go vnto a woman to vncouer hir preuytie, so longe as she hath hir disease in hir vnclennesse.
{18:20} Thou shalt not lye with thy neghbours wife to medle with her, for to defyle thy self withall.
{18:21} Thou shalt not geue of thy sede also, to be burnt vnto Moloch, lest thou vnhalowe the name of thy God, for I am the LORDE.
{18:22} Thou shalt not lye with mankynde as with womankynde, for yt is abhominacion.
{18:23} Thou shalt lye with no maner of beest, to defyle yi self therwith. And no woman shal haue to do wt a beest, for it is abhominacion.
{18:24} Ye shal defyle youre selues in none of these thinges. For ye Heithen (whom I wil cast out before you) haue stayned them selues in all these,
{18:25} and the londe is defyled there thorow. And their wickednesse wyl I vyset vpo them, so that the londe shal spue out the indwellers therof.
{18:26} Therfore kepe ye my statutes and lawes, and do not one of these abhominacions, nether one of youre awne selues ner the straunger amonge you
{18:27} (for all soch abhominacions haue ye people of this lode done which were before you, & haue defyled the lande)
{18:28} that the lande spue not you out also, whan ye haue defyled it, as it spewed out the Heythe, that were there before you.
{18:29} For who so euer commytte these abhominacios, the same soules shalbe roted out from amonge their people.
{18:30} Therfore kepe ye my statutes, that ye do not after ye abhominable customes, which were before you, that ye be not defyled therwith: For I am the LORDE youre God.
{19:1} And the LORDE talked with Moses, and sayde:
{19:2} Speake to the whole congregacion of the children of Israel, and saye vnto them: Ye shall be holy, for I am holy, euen the LORDE youre God.
{19:3} Euery one feare his father and his mother. Kepe my holy dayes: for I am the LORDE youre God.
{19:4} Ye shal not turne youre selues vnto Idols, & ye shal make you no goddes of metall: for I am the LORDE youre God.
{19:5} And whan ye wyll offre health offerynges vnto the LORDE, then shal ye offre the, that he maye be mercifull vnto you,
{19:6} and ye shal eate them the same daye that ye offre them, and on the morow: what so euer is left on the thirde daye, shalbe burnt with fyre.
{19:7} But yf eny man eate therof vpon the thirde daye, then is he vnholy, and shall not be accepted,
{19:8} and the same eater shal beare his synne, because he hath vnhalowed the Sanctuary of the LORDE: and soch a soule shalbe roted out from amonge his people.
{19:9} Whan thou reapest thy londe, thou shalt not reape downe the vttemost borders of it rounde aboute, ner gather it all cleane vp.
{19:10} Euen so likewyse thou shalt not plucke thy vynyarde cleane also, ner gather vp the grapes that are fallen downe, but shalt leaue them for ye poore and straungers: for I am the LORDE youre God.
{19:11} Ye shal not steale, nether lye, ner deale falsely one with another.
{19:12} Ye shal not sweare falsely by my name, & so to vnhalowe the name of thy God: for I am the LORDE.
{19:13} Thou shalt do yi neghboure no wronge, ner robbe him. The workmas laboure shal not byde with the vntyll the mornynge.
{19:14} Thou shalt not curse the deaf. Thou shalt put no stomblynge blocke before ye blinde, but shalt feare thy God: for I am the LORDE.
{19:15} Ye shall not deale wrongeously in iudgment, nether shal ye accepte the personne of the poore, ner honoure the parsonne of the greate, but thou shalt iudge thy neghboure righteously.
{19:16} Thou shalt let no preuy accuser go amoge ye people. Nether shalt thou stonde agaynst yi neghbours bloude: for I am ye LORDE.
{19:17} Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine hert, but shalt tell yi neghboure his faute, that thou beare not synne for his sake.
{19:18} Thou shalt not auenge thy self, ner beare euell will agaynst the childre of thy people. Thou shalt loue thy neghboure, as thy self: for I am the LORDE.
{19:19} My statutes shal ye kepe, that thou let not yi catell gendre with beestes of another kynde: nether sowe thy felde with myngled sede. And let no garment come vpon the, yt is mixte with wollen and lynnen.
{19:20} Whan a man lyeth with a woman, and hath to do with her, which is a bonde woman, and hath bene medled withall of another man, but not lowsed out, ner hath optayned fredome, it shalbe punyshed, but they shal not suffre death, because she was not fre.
{19:21} But he shal brynge for his trespace vnto ye LORDE (euen before the dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse) a ramme for a trespace offerynge:
{19:22} and the prest shal make an attonement for him with the trespace offerynge before the LORDE, concernynge the synne that he hath done: so shall God be mercifull vnto him, as concernynge his synne which he hath done.
{19:23} What tyme as ye are come in to the londe and plante all maner trees wherof men eate, ye shall circumcise the foreskynne of the same with their frutes: thre yeares shall ye holde them for vncircumcysed, so that ye eate them not:
{19:24} but in the fourth yeare shall all their frutes be holy and praysed vnto ye LORDE.
{19:25} In the fifth yeare shall ye eate the frutes, and gather them in: for I am ye LORDE youre God.
{19:26} Ye shal eate nothinge wt bloude. Ye shall not regarde ye foules cryenge, ner chose out dayes.
{19:27} Ye shal shaue no crownes vpo youre heade, nether shalt thou clyppe thy beerde cleane off.
{19:28} Ye shal rente out no markes in youre body (for eny that is deed) ner make lettres vpo you: for I am the LORDE.
{19:29} Thou shalt not holde thy doughter to whordome, that the londe fall not to whordome, and waxe full of wickednesse.
{19:30} Repe my holy dayes, and stonde in awe of my Sanctuary; for I am the LORDE.
{19:31} Ye shal not turne yor selues to ye Soythsayers, and axe nothinge at the expounders of tokes, that ye be not defyled by them: for I am the LORDE youre God.
{19:32} Thou shalt ryse vp before a graye heade, and shalt geue reuerence vnto the aged. For thou shalt feare God: for I am ye LORDE.
{19:33} Whan there dwelleth a straunger amonge you in youre londe, ye shall not vexe him.
{19:34} He shal dwell with you, euen as one that is at home amonge you, & thou shalt loue him as yi self: for ye youre selues also were straungers in the lande of Egipte. I am the LORDE youre God.
{19:35} Ye shal not deale wrogeously in iudgmet, with meteyarde, with weight, with measure:
{19:36} A true balaunce, a true weight, a true Epha, a true Hin shalbe amoge you. For I am the LORDE youre God, which brought you out of the londe of Egipte,
{19:37} that ye shulde kepe & do all my statutes and lawes: for I am the LORDE.
{20:1} And the LORDE talked with Moses, and saide:
{20:2} Tell the children of Israel: Who so euer he be amonge the children of Israel, (or eny straunger that dwelleth in Israel) which geueth of his sede vnto Moloch, the same shall dye the death: the people of the lande shal stone him,
{20:3} & I wyll set my face agaynst that man, and wyll rote him out from amoge his people, because he hath geuen of his sede vnto Moloch, and defyled my Sanctuary, & vnhalowed my holy name.
{20:4} And though the people of the londe loke thorow the fyngers vpon that man, which hath geuen of his sede unto Moloch, so that they put him not to death,
{20:5} yet wyl I set my face agaynst the same man, & agaynst his generacion: And him, and all that go a whorynge with him after Moloch, wyll I rote out from amonge their people.
{20:6} If eny soule turne him to ye soythsayers and expounders of tokens, so that he goeth a whorynge after them, I wyl set my face agaynst the same soule, and wyl rote him out from amonge his people.
{20:7} Sanctifie youre selues therfore, & be holy: for I am holy euen youre God.
{20:8} And kepe ye my statutes, and do them: for I am ye LORDE that sanctifieth you.
{20:9} Who so euer curseth his father or his mother, shall dye the death: his bloude be vpon him, because he hath cursed his father or mother.
{20:10} He that breaketh wedlocke with eny mas wife, shal dye the death (both the aduouterer and ye aduouteresse) because he hath broken wedlocke with his neghbours wife.
{20:11} Yf eny man lye with his fathers wife, so yt he vncouer his fathers preuyte, they shal both dye the death: their bloude be vpo the.
{20:12} Yf eny man lye wt his doughter in lawe, they shall dye both of them, for they have wrought abhominacion: their bloude be vpon them.
{20:13} Yf eny man lye with the mankynde, as with womankynde, they haue wrought abhominacion, & shal both dye the death: their bloude be vpon them.
{20:14} If eny man take a wyfe, and hir mother therto, the same hath wrought wickednes: he shalbe burnt with fyre, and so shal they also, that there be no wickednes amoge you.
{20:15} Yf eny man lye with a beest, he shall dye the death, and the beest shal be slayne.
{20:16} If a woman medle with a beest, so yt she haue to do wt it, thou shalt put her to death, and the beest also, they shall dye the death: their bloude be vpon them.
{20:17} Yf eny man take his sister, his fathers doughter, or his mothers doughter, and se hir preuyte, and she agayne se his secretes, it is a wicked thinge. They shalbe roted out in the sight of their people. For he hath vncouered his sisters preuyte, he shal beare his synne.
{20:18} Yf a man lye with a woman in the tyme of hir sicknesse, and vncouer hir secretes, & open vp hir founteyne, and she vncouer the fountayne of hir bloude, they shall both be roted out from amonge their people.
{20:19} Thou shalt not vncouer the preuytie of thy mothers sister, and of thy fathers sister: for soch one hath vncouered his nexte kynswoman, and they shal beare their synne.
{20:20} Yf eny man lye with his vncles wyfe, the same hath vncovered the preuytie of his uncle: they shall beare their synne, without children shal they dye.
{20:21} Yf eny man take his brothers wyfe, yt is an vncleane thinge: they shalbe without children, because he hath vncouered his brothers secretes.
{20:22} So kepe now all my statutes & my lawes, & do them, yt the lode whither I brynge you to dwell therin, spewe you not out.
{20:23} And walke not ye in ye statutes of the Heithen, which I shal cast out before you. For all soch thinges haue they done, & I haue abhorred the.
{20:24} But I saye vnto you: Ye shall possesse their londe. For I wyll geue you to enheritaunce a lode, that floweth with mylke and hony. I am the LORDE youre God, which haue separated you from the nacions,
{20:25} that ye also shulde separate the cleane beestes fro the vncleane, and the vncleane foules from the cleane: & not to defyle youre soules vpon beestes, vpon foules & vpon all that crepeth on the grounde: which I haue separated vnto you, that they shulde be vncleane.
{20:26} Therfore shall ye be holy vnto me: for I the LORDE am holy, which haue separated you fro the nacions, that ye shulde be myne.
{20:27} Yf a man or woman be a soythsayer or an expounder of tokens, the same shall dye the death: they shalbe stoned, their bloude be vpon them.
{21:1} And the LORDE sayde vnto Moses: Speake to ye prestes ye sonnes of Aaron, & saye vnto the: A prest shal defyle him self vpo no soule of his people,
{21:2} but vpon his nexte kynne yt belongeth vnto him: as vpon his mother, vpo his father, vpo his sonne, vpo his doughter, vpon his brother,
{21:3} & vpon his sister, which is yet a virgin, & hath bene no mans wife (which belongeth vnto him) vpon her maie he defyle himself.
{21:4} Morouer he shal not defyle him self vpo eny ruler in his people, to vnhalowe him self.
{21:5} He shall make no crowne also vpon his heade, ner shaue of his beerd, nether shall they cut out eny markes i their fleshe.
{21:6} They shalbe holy vnto their God, and not vnhalowe ye name of their God: for they offre the sacrifice of the LORDE, the bred of their God, therfore shal they be holy.
{21:7} They shal take no whore, ner one that is defyled, or yt is put awaye from hir husbande, for he is holy vnto his God:
{21:8} therfore shal he sanctifie him self, for he offreth the bred of thy God. He shal be holy vnto the, for I am holy, even the LORDE that sanctifieth you.
{21:9} Yf a prestes doughter fall to whoringe, she shalbe burnt with fyre, for she hath shamed hir father.
{21:10} He that is hye prest amonge his brethren, vpo whose heade the anoyntinge oyle is poured, and his hande fylled (yt he might be arayed with the vestimentes) shal not vncouer his heade, ner cut his clothes,
{21:11} & shal come at no deed, & shal defyle him self nether vpon father ner mother.
{21:12} He shall not go out of the Sanctuary, that he vnhalowe not the Sanctuary of his God. For ye crowne of the anoyntinge oyle of his God is vpon him, for I am the LORDE.
{21:13} A virgin shal he take to wife,
{21:14} but no wedowe, ner deuorsed, ner defyled, ner whore, but a virgin of his awne people shal he take to wife,
{21:15} yt he vnhalowe not his sede amonge his people. For I am ye LORDE, which sanctifie him.
{21:16} And ye LORDE talked wt Moses, & sayde:
{21:17} Speake vnto Aaron, & saie: Yf there be a blemysh vpo eny of yi sede in yor generacions, the same shal not preasse to offre the bred of his God:
{21:18} For who so euer hath a blemysh vpon him, shal not come nere, whether he be blynde, lame, with an euell fauoured nose, wt eny mysshappen membre,
{21:19} or yt hath a broken fote or hande,
{21:20} or is croke backed, or hath eny blemysh in the eye, or is gleyd, or is skyrvye or scaulde, or hath his stones broken.
{21:21} Who so euer now of the sede of Aaron ye prest hath eny blemysh vpo him, shal not come nye to offre ye sacrifice of the LORDE. For he hath a deformyte. Therfore shall he not preasse vnto the bred of his God, to offre it.
{21:22} Notwithstondinge he shal eate of the bred of his God, both of the holy, & of ye most holy:
{21:23} but he shal not go into ye vayle, ner come nye the altare (for so moch as he hath a blemysh vpo him) yt he vnhalowe not my Sactuary. For I am ye LORDE yt sanctifieth the.
{21:24} And Moses spake this vnto Aaron & to his sonnes, and to all the children of Israel.
{22:1} And the LORDE talked with Moses, & sayde:
{22:2} Speake vnto Aaron, & his sonnes, yt they absteyne from ye halowed thinges of the childre of Israel, which they haue halowed vnto me, & yt they vnhalowe not my holy name: for I am ye LORDE.
{22:3} Saie now vnto them & their posterities: Who so euer he be of yor sede, yt commeth nye vnto the holy thinges, which the childre of Israel halowe vnto the LORDE, & so defyleth him self vpon the same, his soule shal perishe before my face: for I am the LORDE.
{22:4} Who so euer of the sede of Aaron is a leper, or hath a runnynge yssue, shall not eate of the holy thinges, tyll he be clensed. Who so toucheth eny vncleane thinge, or whose sede departeth from him by night,
{22:5} or who so toucheth eny worme that is vncleane vnto him, or a ma yt is vncleane vnto him,
{22:6} & what so euer defyleth hi, loke what soule toucheth eny soch, is vncleane vntyll the euen, & shall not eate of the holy thinges, but shall first bath his flesh with water.
{22:7} And wha ye Sonne is gone downe, and he cleane, then maye he eate therof, for it is his foode.
{22:8} Loke what dyeth alone, or is rent of wylde beestes, shall he not eate, yt he be not vncleane theron: for I am ye LORDE.
{22:9} Therfore shal they kepe my lawe, yt they lade not synne vpon them, & dye therin, whan they vnhalowe them selues in it. For I am ye LORDE, yt halowe them.
{22:10} A straunger shal not eate of the holy thinges, ner an housholde gest of the prestes, ner an hyred seruaut.
{22:11} But yf ye prest bye a soule for his money, ye same maye eate therof. And loke who is borne in his house, maye eate of his bred also.
{22:12} Neuertheles yf the prestes doughter be a straungers wife, she shal not eate of the Heueofferinges of holynes.
{22:13} But yf she be a wedowe, or deuorced, or haue no sede, & commeth agayne to hir fathers house as a fore (whan she was yet a mayden in hir fathers house) then shall she eate of hir fathers bred. But no strauger shal eate therof.
{22:14} Who so els eateth of the halowed thynges, vnwyttingly, shal put ye fifth parte there vnto, and geue it vnto the prest with the halowed thinge,
{22:15} that they vnhalowe not ye halowed thinges of the children of Israel, which they Heue vp vnto the LORDE,
{22:16} lest they lade them selues with mysdoinge and trespace, wha they eate their halowed thynges, for I am ye LORDE which halowe the.
{22:17} And ye LORDE talked wt Moses, & saide:
{22:18} Speake vnto Aaron & his sonnes, & to all ye childre of Israel: What so euer Israelite or straunger in Israel wyll do his offerynge, whether it be their vowe, or of fre wyl, that they wyll offre a burntofferynge vnto the LORDE,
{22:19} to reconcyle them selues, it shal be a male, and without blemysh, of the oxen, or lambes or goates.
{22:20} What so euer hath eny blemish, shal they not offre, for they shal fynde no fauoure therwith.
{22:21} And who so wyl offre an health offeringe vnto the LORDE to separate out a vowe, or of fre wyl, oxen or shepe, it shalbe without blemysh, yt it maye be accepted. It shal haue no deformite.
{22:22} Yf it be blynde, or broke, or wounded, or haue a wen, or skyrvye, or scabbed, they shal offre none soch vnto the LORDE, ner put an offerynge of eny soch vpo the altare of the LORDE.
{22:23} An oxe or shepe yt hath mysshappe membres, or no rompe, mayest thou offre of a fre wyll: but to a vowe it maye not be accepted.
{22:24} Thou shalt offre also vnto the LORDE nothinge yt is brused, or broken, or rent, or cutt out, & ye shal do no soch in youre londe.
{22:25} Morouer ye shall offre no bred vnto youre God of a straungers hande: for it is marred of him, and he hath a deformite, therfore shal it not be accepted for you.
{22:26} And the LORDE spake vnto Moses, & sayde:
{22:27} Wha an oxe, or labe, or goate is brought forth, it shal be seuen dayes with the dame, and vpon the eight daye & therafter it maie be offered vnto the LORDE, the is it accepted.
{22:28} Whether it be oxe or lambe, it shall not be slayne with his yonge in one daye.
{22:29} But wha ye wil offre a thakoffringe vnto the LORDE yt it maye be accepted,
{22:30} ye shal eate it the same daye, & kepe nothinge ouer vntyll the mornynge: for I am the LORDE.
{22:31} Therfore kepe now my commaundementes, and do them: for I am the LORDE,
{22:32} yt ye vnhalowe not my holy name, & that I maye be halowed amonge the children of Israel. For I am he that halowe you, eue ye LORDE,
{22:33} which brought you out of ye lode of Egipte, yt I might be yor God: Euen I ye LORDE.
{23:1} And the LORDE talked with Moses, & sayde:
{23:2} Speake vnto ye children of Israel, and saye vnto them: These are ye feastes of the LORDE, which ye shal call holy dayes.
{23:3} Sixe dayes shalt thou worke, but the seuenth daie is the rest of the Sabbath, and shalbe called holy. Ye shal do no worke therin, for it is the Sabbath of the LORDE, where so euer ye dwell.
{23:4} These are the feastes of the LORDE, yt are called holy, which ye shal call youre feastes:
{23:5} Upon ye fourtene daye of ye first moneth at euen, is the LORDES Easter.
{23:6} And vpon ye fiftene daye of the same moneth is the feast of vnleueded bred of the LORDE. Then shall ye eate vnleuended bred seuen dayes.
{23:7} The first daie shalbe called holy amonge you, ye shal do no worke of bodage therin,
{23:8} seue daies shal ye offre vnto ye LORDE. The seueth daie shalbe called holy likewise, wherin ye shal do no worke of bondage also.
{23:9} And ye LORDE talked wt Moses, & sayde:
{23:10} Speake to the childre of Israel, & saye vnto them: Whan ye come into the lande yt I shall geue you, and reape downe youre haruest, ye shal brynge a shefe of the first frutes of youre haruest vnto the prest,
{23:11} the shall the shefe be waued before the LORDE, that ye maye be accepted: but this shal the prest do the nexte daye after the Sabbath.
{23:12} And ye same daie that yor shefe is waued, shal ye offre a burntofferinge vnto the LORDE, of a lambe which is without blemysh and of one yeare olde,
{23:13} wt the meatofferynge, two tenth deales of fyne floure mengled with oyle, for an offerynge of a swete sauoure vnto the LORDE: & the drynk offerynge also, eue the fourth parte of an Hin of wyne.
{23:14} And ye shall eate nether bred, nor cakes, ner furmentye (of new corne) tyll the same daye that ye brynge an offerynge vnto youre God. This shalbe a lawe vnto youre posterities, where so euer ye dwell.
{23:15} Then shal ye nombre (from the nexte daye after the Sabbath, whan ye brought ye Waueshefe) seuen whole wekes,
{23:16} vntyll the nexte daie after ye seueth weke, namely, fiftie daies, shal ye nombre, and offre new meatofferynges vnto the LORDE.
{23:17} And out of all youre dwellinges shal ye offre, namely, two Waue loaues of two tenth deales of fyne floure leueded, and baken for the first frutes vnto ye LORDE.
{23:18} And with youre bred ye shal brynge seuen lambes of one yeare olde without blemysh, and a yonge bullocke, and two rammes: this shalbe the LORDES burntofferynge, meatofferynge, and drynkoffrynge. This is a sacrifice of a swete sauoure vnto the LORDE.
{23:19} Morouer ye shal offre an he goate for a synofferynge, and two lambes of a yeare olde for an healthofferynge.
{23:20} And ye prest shal waue it vpon the bred of the first frutes before the LORDE with the two lambes: And they shalbe holy vnto the LORDE, and shalbe the prestes.
{23:21} And this daye shal ye proclame, for it shalbe called holy amonge you: no seruyle worke shal ye do therin. A perpetuall lawe shall it be amonge yor posterities, where so euer ye dwell.
{23:22} Whan ye reape downe ye haruest of youre londe, ye shal not cut it cleane downe vpo the felde, ner gather vp all, but shal leaue it for the poore and straungers. I am the LORDE youre God.
{23:23} And ye LORDE talked with Moses, and sayde:
{23:24} Speake vnto the children of Israel, & saye: Vpon the first daye of the seuenth moneth shal ye haue the holy rest of the remembraunce of blowinge,
{23:25} wherin ye shal do no seruyle worke, and ye shal offre sacrifice vnto the LORDE.
{23:26} And the LORDE spake vnto Moses, and sayde:
{23:27} Vpon the tenth daye in this seuenth moneth is the daye of reconcylinge, which shalbe an holy conuocacion wt you. Ye shal humble youre soules therin, and offre vnto the LORDE,
{23:28} and shal do no seruyle worke in this daye: for it is the daye of attonement, that ye maye be reconcyled before the LORDE youre God.
{23:29} For what soule so euer humbleth not him self vpon this daye, the same shalbe roted out from amonge his people.
{23:30} And what soule so euer doth eny worke this daye, the same wil I destroye from amonge his people:
{23:31} therfore shall ye do no worke. This shalbe a perpetuall lawe vnto youre posterities, where so euer ye dwell.
{23:32} It is the rest of youre Sabbath, that ye maye humble youre soules. Vpon the nyenth daye of ye moneth at euen, shal ye kepe this holy daye from the euen forth vntyll the eue agayne.
{23:33} And the LORDE talked with Moses, & sayde:
{23:34} Vpon the fiftene daye of the seuenth moneth, is the feast of Tabernacles seuen dayes vnto the LORDE.
{23:35} The first daye shalbe an holy couocacion: no seruyle worke shal ye do therin.
{23:36} Seuen dayes shal ye offre vnto the LORDE. The eight daye shalbe an holy conuocacion vnto you also, and ye shal offre vnto the LORDE: for it is the daye of gatheringe together: No seruyle worke shall ye do therin.
{23:37} These are the holy daies of the LORDE, which ye shall proclame and holde for holy conuocacions, that ye maye offre vnto the LORDE burntofferynges, meatofferynges, drynkofferynges and other offerynges, euery one acordinge to his daye,
{23:38} besyde ye Sabbathes of ye LORDE, and youre giftes, and vowes, and frewylofferynges, that ye offre vnto the LORDE.
{23:39} So vpon the fiftene daye of the seuenth moneth, whan ye haue brought in the increase of the londe, ye shall kepe the LORDES feast seuen dayes longe. The first daye shalbe kepte holy daye, and the eight daye shalbe kepte holy daye also.
{23:40} And vpon the first daie ye shal take of ye goodly frutefull trees, braunches of palme trees, & bowes of thicke trees, and Wyllies of the broke, and seue dayes shal ye be mery before ye LORDE youre God:
{23:41} and thus shal ye kepe the feast vnto the LORDE seuen dayes in the yeare. This shalbe a perpetuall lawe amonge youre posterities, that they kepe holy daye thus in ye seuenth moneth.
{23:42} Seuen dayes shal ye dwell in bothes. Who so euer is an Israelite borne, shal dwell in bothes,
{23:43} that they which come after you, maye knowe, how that I made ye children of Israel to dwell in bothes, whan I brought them out of the lode of Egipte. I am the LORDE youre God.
{23:44} And Moses tolde the children of Israel these holy daies of the LORDE.
{24:1} And the LORDE spake vnto Moses, & sayde:
{24:2} Comaunde the children of Israel, that they brynge pure oyle olyue beaten for lightes, that it maye be allwaye put in the lampes,
{24:3} without before the vayle of wytnesse in the Tabernacle of wytnesse. And Aaron shall dresse it allwaye at euen & in ye mornynge before the LORDE. Let this be a perpetuall lawe vnto youre posterities.
{24:4} The lapes shal he dresse vpon the pure candilsticke before the LORDE perpetually.
{24:5} And thou shalt take fyne floure, and bake twolue cakes therof: two teth deales shal euery cake haue,
{24:6} & thou shalt laye them sixe on a rowe vpo the pure table before the LORDE.
{24:7} And vpon the same shalt thou laye pure frankencense, that it maye be bred of remembraunce for an offerynge vnto ye LORDE.
{24:8} Euery Sabbath shal he prepare the before the LORDE allwaye, and receaue them of the children of Israel for an euerlastinge couenaunt.
{24:9} And they shalbe Aarons & and his sonnes, which shal eate them in the holy place. For this is his most holy of the offerynges of the LORDE for a perpetuall dewtye.
{24:10} And there wente out an Israelitish womans sonne, which was the childe of a man of Egipte (amonge the children of Israel) and stroue in ye hoost
{24:11} with a man of Israel, & named the name of God blasphemously, & cursed. Then brought they him vnto Moses. His mothers name was Selomith, the doughter of Dibri, of the trybe of Dan.
{24:12} And they put him in preson, tyll they were infourmed by the mouth of the LORDE.
{24:13} And the LORDE spake vnto Moses, and sayde:
{24:14} Brynge him that cursed, out of the hoost, and let all the that herde it, laye their handes vpon his heade, and let the whole congregacion stone him.
{24:15} And saye vnto the childre of Israel. Who so euer blasphemeth his God, shall beare his synne:
{24:16} and he that blasphemeth the name of the LORDE, shal dye the death. The whole congregacio shal stone him. As the straunger, so shal he of the housholde be also. Yf he blaspheme the name, he shal dye.
{24:17} He that slayeth a man, shall dye ye death.
{24:18} but he that slayeth a beest, shall paye for it. Soule for soule.
{24:19} And he that maymeth his neghboure, it shall be done vnto him, euen as he hath done:
{24:20} broke for broke, eye for eye, tothe for tothe: euen as he hath maymed a a man, so shal it be done vnto him agayne,
{24:21} so that, who so slayeth a beest, shall paye for it: But he that slayeth a man, shal dye.
{24:22} There shal be one maner of lawe amonge you, to ye straunger as to one of youre selues: for I am the LORDE youre God.
{24:23} Moses tolde the children of Israel. And they brought him that had cursed, out of ye hoost, and stoned him. Thus dyd the childre of Israel as the LORDE comaunded Moses.
{25:1} And the LORDE talked with Moses vpon mount Sinai, and sayde:
{25:2} Speake to the children of Israel, and saye vnto them: Whan ye come in to the londe, yt I shal geue you, the londe shal rest vnto the LORDE,
{25:3} so that thou sowe thy felde sixe yeares, and sixe yeares cut yi vynes, and gather in the frutes.
{25:4} But in the seuenth yeare the lode shal haue his Sabbath of rest for a Sabbath vnto the LORDE, wherin thou shalt not sowe thy felde ner cut thy vynes.
{25:5} Loke what groweth of it self after thy haruest, thou shalt not reape it. And the grapes that growe without thy laboure, shalt thou not gather, for so moch as it is the yeare of the londes rest:
{25:6} But the rest of the londe shalt thou kepe for this intent, that thou mayest eate therof, thy seruaunte, thy mayde, thy hyrelinge, thy gest, thy strauger with the,
{25:7} thy catell, and the beestes in thy londe. All the increase shal be meate.
{25:8} And thou shalt nombre seuen of these yeare Sabbathes, that seuen yeares maye be tolde seuen tymes, and so the tyme of the seuen yeare Sabbathes make nyne and fourtye yeares.
{25:9} Then shalt thou let the blast of the horne go thorow all youre londe, vpon the tenth daye of the seuenth moneth, euen in ye daye of attonement.
{25:10} And ye shal halowe the fiftieth yeare, and shall call it a fre yeare in ye londe, for all them that dwell therin: for it is the yeare of Iubilye. Then shall euery one amonge you come agayne to his possession and to his kynred:
{25:11} for the fiftieth yeare is ye yeare of Iubilye. Ye shal not sowe ner reape it that groweth of it self, ner gather the grapes, that growe without laboure.
{25:12} For the yeare of Iubilye shall be holy amonge you. But loke what the felde beareth, that shall ye eate.
{25:13} This is the yeare of Iubilye, wherin ye shal come againe euery man to his owne.
{25:14} Now whan thou sellest ought vnto thy neghboure, or byest eny thinge of him, there shal none of you oppresse his brother:
{25:15} but acordinge to the nombre of the yeare of Iubilye shalt thou bye it of him: and acordinge to the nombre of the yeares of increase shall he sell it vnto the.
{25:16} Acordinge to the multitude of the yeares shalt thou rayse the pryce, & and acordynge to the fewnesse of the yeares shalt thou mynish the pryce: for he shall sell it vnto the acordinge to the nombre of the increase.
{25:17} Therfore let no man defraude his neghboure, but feare yi God. For I am the LORDE youre God.
{25:18} Wherfore do after my statutes, and kepe my lawes, so yt ye do them that ye maye dwell safe in the londe.
{25:19} For the londe shal geue you hir frute, so that ye shal haue ynough to eate, and dwell safe therin.
{25:20} And yf ye wolde saye: What shall we eate in the seuenth yeare, in as moch as we shal not sowe, ner gather in oure increase?
{25:21} I wyll sende my blessynge vpon you in the sixte yeare,
{25:22} that it shal brynge forth frute for thre yeare: so that ye shal sowe in ye eight yeare, and eate of the olde frute vntyll the nyenth yeare, that ye maye eate of the olde tyll new frutes come agayne.
{25:23} Therfore shall ye not sell the londe for euer, for the lode is myne. And ye are straungers and indwellers before me.
{25:24} And in all youre lande shall ye geue the londe to lowse.
{25:25} Whan thy brother waxeth poore, and selleth ye his possession, and his nexte kynsma commeth to him, yt he maye redeme it: then shall he redeme that his brother solde.
{25:26} But whan a man hath none to redeme it, and ca get so moch with his hande as to redeme one parte,
{25:27} then shall it be rekened how many yeares it hath bene solde, and the remnaunt shal be restored vnto him to whom he solde it, yt he maie come agayne to his possession.
{25:28} But yf his hande can not get so moch, as to haue one parte agayne, the shal it yt he solde be styll in the hande of the byer vntyll ye yeare of Iubilye: In ye same shal it go out, and returne to his owner agayne.
{25:29} He that selleth a dwellinge house within the walles of the cite, hath an whole yeare respyte to lowse it out agayne: that shall be the tyme, wherin he maye redeme it.
{25:30} But yf he redeme it not a fore the whole yeare be out then shal he that bought it, and his successours kepe it for euer, and it shall not go out lowse in the yeare of Iubylie.
{25:31} Neuertheles yf it be an house in a vyllage that hath no wall aboute it, it shall be counted like vnto the felde of the coutre, and maye be redemed and shal go out fre in the yeare of Iubilye.
{25:32} The cities of the Leuites, and the houses in the cities that their possession is in, maye allwaye be redemed.
{25:33} Who so purchaceth ought of the Leuites, shal leaue it in the yeare of Iubilye, whether it be house or cite that he hath had in possession. For the houses in the cities of the Leuites are their possession amonge the children of Israel.
{25:34} But the felde before their cities shal not be solde, for it is their awne for euer.
{25:35} Whan thy brother waxeth poore, and falleth in decaye besyde the, thou shalt receaue him as a straunger, or gest, that he maye lyue by the:
{25:36} and thou shalt take no vsury of him, ner more then thou hast geue, but shalt feare thy God, that thy brother maye lyue besydes the.
{25:37} For thou shalt not lende him yi money vpon vsury, ner delyuer him thy meate vpon vauntage.
{25:38} For I am the LORDE yor God, which haue brought you out of the lode of Egipte, to geue you the lande of Canaan, and to be youre God.
{25:39} Whan thy brother waxeth poore besyde the, and selleth himself vnto the, thou shalt not holde him as a bode ma:
{25:40} but as an hyred seruaunte and as a soiourner shall he be wt the, and serue the vntyll ye yeare of Iubilye.
{25:41} Then shal he departe lowse from the, & his childre with him, & shal returne to his awne kinred, and to his fathers possession:
{25:42} for they are my seruauntes, whom I brought out of the londe of Egipte. Therfore shal they not be solde like bondmen.
{25:43} And thou shalt not raigne ouer them with crueltie, but shalt feare thy God.
{25:44} But yf thou wylt haue bode seruauntes and maydens, thou shalt bye them of the Heithen, that are rounde aboute you:
{25:45} of the children of the soiourners and straungers amonge you, and of their generacions with you, and that are borne in youre londe, the same shal ye haue for bonde seruautes,
{25:46} & shal possesse them, & youre children after you for an euerlastinge possession, these shalbe yor bondmen. But ouer youre brethren the children of Israel, there shall none of you raigne ouer another with crueltie.
{25:47} Whan a straunger or soiourner waxeth ryche by the, and thy brother waxeth poore besyde him, & selleth him self vnto ye straunger or soiourner by the, or to eny of his kynne, then shall he haue right
{25:48} (after that he is solde) to be redemed agayne. And eny of his brethren maye lowse him out:
{25:49} or his vncle or his vncles sonne, or eny other kynsman of his kynred: Or yf his awne hande getteth so moch, he shal lowse him self out,
{25:50} and shal reken with him that bought him, from ye yeare that he solde him self, vntyll the yeare of Iubilye. And ye money shal be counted acordinge to the nombre of the yeares that he was solde, and his wages of the whole tyme shalbe rekened withall.
{25:51} Yf there be yet many yeares vnto ye yeare of Iubilye, then shal he (acordinge to the same) geue the more for his delyueraunce, therafter as he is solde.
{25:52} Yf there remayne but few yeares vnto the yeare of Iubilye, then shall he geue agayne therafter for his redempcion.
{25:53} And his wages from yeare to yeare shall he reken withall, and thou shalt not let the other raigne cruelly ouer him in yi sight.
{25:54} But yf he bye not him self out after this maner, then shal he go out fre in the yeare of Iubilye, and his childre with him:
{25:55} for the childre of Israel are my seruauntes, which I haue brought out of the londe of Egipte. I am the LORDE youre God.
{26:1} Ye shall make you no Idols ner ymage, and ye shal reare you vp no piler, ner set vp eny markstone in youre londe, to bowe youre selues therto. For I am the LORDE youre God.
{26:2} Kepe my Sabbathes, and stonde in awe of my Sanctuary. I am the LORDE.
{26:3} Yf ye wyll walke now in my statutes, and kepe my commaundementes and do them,
{26:4} the wyl I geue you rayne in due season, and ye londe shal geue hir increase, and the trees of ye felde shal brynge forth their frute.
{26:5} And the thresshinge tyme shall reache vnto the wyne haruest, and the wyne haruest shal reache vnto the sowynge tyme. And ye shall eate yor bred in plenteousnes, and shal dwell safe in youre londe.
{26:6} I wil geue peace in youre londe, so that ye shall slepe, and no man shall make you afrayed. I wyl ryd euell beestes out of youre londe, and there shall no swerde go thorow youre londe.
{26:7} Ye shal chace youre enemies, & they shal fall into ye swerde before you.
{26:8} Fyue of you shal chace an hundreth: and an hundreth of you shal chace ten thousande. For youre enemies shall fall in to the swerde before you.
{26:9} And I wyl turne me vnto you, and wyl cause you to growe and increase, and wyl set vp my couenanut with you.
{26:10} And ye shal eate of the olde stoare, and shall let go the olde for plenteousnesse of the new.
{26:11} I will haue my dwellynge amonge you, and my soule shall not refuse you.
{26:12} And I wyll walke amonge you, and wyl be youre God, and ye shalbe my people.
{26:13} For I am the LORDE youre God, which brought you out of the londe of Egipte, that ye shulde not be their bondmen. And I haue broke the cepter of youre yocke, and caused you to go vp right.
{26:14} But yf ye wil not harken vnto me, ner do all these commaundementes,
{26:15} and wyl despyse my statutes, and yf youre soules refuse my lawes, yt ye wyll not do all my commaundementes, & shal let my couenaunt stonde,
{26:16} then wyll I do this agayne vnto you. I wyl vyset you shortly with swellynges and feuers, which shal destroye ye eyes, & consume awaie ye hert. Ye shal sowe youre sede in vayne, and youre enemies shal eate it vp.
{26:17} And I wyl set my face agaynst you, and ye shal be slayne before youre enemies. And they that hate you, shal haue dominion ouer And ye shall flye, wha no man chaseth you.
{26:18} But yf ye wyll not herken vnto me for all this, then wyl I make it yet seuen tymes more, to punysh you for youre synnes,
{26:19} that I maye breake ye pryde of youre strength, and wyl make youre heauen lyke yron, and youre earth as brasse:
{26:20} and youre trauaile and labor shal be but lost, so that youre londe shall not geue hir increase, and the trees in the londe shal not brynge forth their frute.
{26:21} Yf ye walke yet agaynst me, and wyll not harken vnto me, then wyl I make it yet seuen tymes more, to punysh you because of youre synnes:
{26:22} & wyl sende wylde beestes amoge you, which shal robbe you, and destroie youre catell, and make you fewer, and youre hye waye shal be come waist.
{26:23} But yf ye wyl not yet be refourmed here withall, and wyll walke contrary vnto me,
{26:24} then wyl I walke contrary vnto you also, & wyll punysh you yet seuen tymes for youre synnes.
{26:25} And I wyl brynge vpon you a swerde of vengeaunce, which shall auenge my Testament. And though ye gather you together in to youre cities, yet wyll I sende the pestilence amonge you, and wyll delyuer you in to the handes of youre enemies.
{26:26} For I wil destroye youre prouysion of bred, so yt ten wemen shall bake youre bred in one ouen, and youre bred shal be delyuered out by weight. And whan ye eate, ye shall not haue ynough.
{26:27} Yf ye wyl not yet for all this harken vnto me, & wyl walke contrary vnto me,
{26:28} then wyll I also walke cotrary vnto you in wrathfull displeasure, and wyll punysh you seuenfolde because of youre synnes,
{26:29} so that ye shal eate the flesh of youre sonnes and doughters.
{26:30} And I wyl destroye youre hye altares, and rote out youre ymages, and wyll cast youre bodies vpon the bodies of youre Idols, and my soule shall abhorre you.
{26:31} And youre cities wyll I make waist, and brynge youre churches to naught, and wyll not smell youre swete odoures.
{26:32} Thus wyll I make the londe desolate, so that youre enemies shall dwell therin, and make it waist:
{26:33} but you will I scater amonge the Heythen, and drawe out the swerde after you, so that youre londe shal be waist, & youre cities desolate.
{26:34} Then shall the londe reioyse in hir Sabbathes, as longe as it lyeth wayst, and ye be in the enemies londe. Yee then shal the londe kepe holy daye, and reioyse in hir rest,
{26:35} as longe as it lieth wayst, because it coude not rest in youre Sabbathes, whan ye dwelt therin.
{26:36} And as for them that remayne of you, I wyll make them faynte harted in the londe of their enemies, so that a shakynge leaf shall chace them. And they shall flye from it, as though a swerde persecuted them, and shal fall noman folowynge vpon them.
{26:37} And they shall fall one vpon another (as it were before the swerde) and noman yet chacynge them. And ye shall not be so bolde, as to withstonde youre enemies,
{26:38} and shal perishe amonge the Heithen, and the londe of youre enemies shal eate you vp.
{26:39} And they that are left of you, shall pyne awaye in their mysdede, euen in the enemies londe, and in the mysdedes of their fathers shall they consume awaye.
{26:40} Then shall they knowlege their mysdedes, and the mysdedes of their fathers in the trespace, wherwith they haue trespaced agaynst me, and walked contrary vnto me.
{26:41} Therfore wyll I also walke contrary vnto the, and wyll brynge them in to the enemies londe. Then shal their vncircumcysed herte be tamed. And then shall they ende their mysdedes.
{26:42} And I shal thinke vpo my couenaut with Iacob, and vpon my couenaunt with Isaac, and vpon my couenaunt with Abraham, and wyl thynke vpon the lode.
{26:43} As for the londe, whan it shalbe left of them, it shal reioyse in hir Sabbathes, euen then, whan it lyeth waist, and they tylle it not. And they shall make attonement for their mysdedes, because they despysed my lawes, & their soules refused my statutes.
{26:44} Morouer I haue not so refused them, that they shulde be in the enemies londe: nether haue I so vtterly abhorred them, that I wolde brynge them to naught, and breake my couenaunt wt them: for I am ye LORDE their God.
{26:45} And for their sake I wyl remebre my first couenaut, wha I brought them out of ye londe of Egipte in the sight of the Heythen, yt I might be their God. Euen I the LORDE.
{26:46} These are the ordinaunces, statutes and lawes, which ye LORDE made betwixte him and the children of Israel vpon mount Sinai, by the hande of Moses.
{27:1} And the LORDE talked with Moses, & sayde:
{27:2} Speake to ye children of Israel, & saye vnto them: Yf eny man make a speciall vowe vnto ye LORDE, so yt he pryse a soule, then shal this be the valuacion:
{27:3} A ma of twentye yeare olde vnto the thre score yeare, shalt thou set at fiftie syluer Sycles, after the Sycle of the Sanctuary:
{27:4} but a woman at thirtie Sycles.
{27:5} Yf it be fyue yeare olde vnto twentye yeare, thou shalt set it at twentye Sycles, whan it is a man childe: but a woman at ten Sycles.
{27:6} Yf it be a moneth olde vnto fiue yeare, thou shalt set it at fyue Sycles of syluer, whan it is a machilde: but a woman at thre Syluer Sycles.
{27:7} Yf he be thre score yeare olde and aboue, the shalt thou set him at fiftene Sicles wha it is a ma a woma at te Sicles.
{27:8} Yf he be to poore so to be set, the let him present himself to ye prest, & ye prest shal value him. Neuertheles he shal value him, acordinge as ye hade of him that vowed, is able to get.
{27:9} But yf it be a beest yt maye be offred vnto ye LORDE, all yt is offred vnto ye LORDE of soch, is holy:
{27:10} it shal not be altered ner chaunged, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good. Yf eny man chaunge it, one beest for another, then shal they both be holy vnto ye LORDE.
{27:11} But yf ye beest be vncleane which maye not be offred vnto ye LORDE, the shal it be set, before ye prest,
{27:12} and ye prest shal value it, whether it be good or bad, & it shal stonde at the prestes valuynge.
{27:13} But yf eny man wil bye it out, he shal geue the fifth parte more, to that it was set at.
{27:14} Whan eny ma sanctifieth his house vnto the LORDE for ye Sanctuary, the prest shall value it, whether it be good or bad. And as the prest valueth it, so shal it stonde.
{27:15} But yf he yt sanctified it, wyl redeme it, he shal geue ye fifth parte of syluer therto, aboue that it was set at: So shal it be his.
{27:16} Yf eny man halowe a pece of lode of his heretage vnto the LORDE, it shalbe set acordinge to yt it beareth. Yf it beare an Homer of barlye, it shalbe valued at fiftye Sycles of syluer.
{27:17} But yf he halowe his londe immediatly from the yeare of Iubilye forth, then shal it be set acordinge to ye value therof.
{27:18} Yf he haue halowed it after the yeare of Iubilye, then shal the prest reke it, acordinge to ye yeares yt remayne vnto ye yeare of Iubilye, & therafter shal he set it the lower.
{27:19} But yf he yt sanctified the londe, wil redeme it agayne, then shal he geue the fifth parte of syluer therto, aboue that it was set at:
{27:20} So shal it be his. Yf he wil not lowse it out, but selleth it vnto another, then shal he redeme it nomore:
{27:21} but the same londe whan it goeth out fre in ye yeare of Iubilye, shal be holy vnto the LORDE, as a dedicated felde, and shalbe the prestes inheritaunce.
{27:22} Yf eny man halowe vnto the LORDE a felde, which he hath bought, and is not his inheritaunce,
{27:23} then shal ye prest reken it, what it is worth vnto the yeare of Iubilye, & the same daye shall he geue the pryce that it is set at, vnto the LORDE for the Sanctuary.
{27:24} But in ye yeare of Iubilye it shal returne vnto him that bought it, yt it maye be his inheritaunce in the londe.
{27:25} All maner of prysinge shalbe made acordinge to the Sycle of the Sactuary. One Sycle maketh xx. Geras.
{27:26} The first borne amonge ye catell (which belongeth vnto the LORDE) shall no man Sanctifie vnto the LORDE, whether it be oxe or shepe, for it is the LORDES all ready.
{27:27} But yf there be eny vncleane thinge vpon the beest, the shal it be lowsed out therafter as it is worth, and the fifth parte shalbe geuen more therto. Yf he wil not redeme it, the let it be solde, as it is worth.
{27:28} There shall no dedicated thinge be solde ner bought out, yt eny man dedicateth vnto ye LORDE, of all yt is his good, whether it be me, catell or lode. For euery dedicated thige, is most holy vnto ye LORDE.
{27:29} There shal no dedicated thige of ma be bought out, but shal dye the death.
{27:30} All the tythes in the londe, both of the sede of the londe, & of ye frutes of the trees, are the LORDES, & shal be holy vnto the LORDE.
{27:31} But yf eny man wil redeme his tithes, he shall geue the fifth parte more therto.
{27:32} And all the tithes of oxen & shepe, & that goeth vnder the rod, the same is an holy tythe vnto the LORDE.
{27:33} It shall not be axed whether it be good or bad, nether shall it be chaunged. But yf eny man chaunge it, then both it & that it was chaunged withall, shal be holy, & not redemed.
{27:34} These are the comaundementes, which ye LORDE gaue Moses in charge vnto childre of Israel vpon mount Sinai.

{1:1} This is the worde of the LORDE, that came vnto Ioel the sonne of Phatuel:
{1:2} Heare o ye elders: podre this wel, all ye that dwell in the lode: yf euer there happened soch a thinge in youre dayes, or in ye dayes of youre fathers.
{1:3} Tell youre children of it, & let them shewe it vnto their children, & so they to certifie their posterite therof.
{1:4} Loke what the caterpiller hath lefte, yt hath the greshopper eaten vp: what the greshopper lefte, that hath the locuste eaten vp: & what the locuste hath lefte, that hath the blastinge consumed.
{1:5} Wake vp ye dronckardes, & wepe: mourne all ye wyne suppers, because of youre swete wyne, for it shal be taken awaye from youre mouth.
{1:6} Yee a mightie & an innumerable people shall come vp in to my londe: these haue teth like the teth of lyons, & chaftbones like the lyonesses.
{1:7} They shal make my vinyarde waist, they shal pyll of the barckes of my fygetrees, strype them bare, cast them awaye, and make the braunches whyte.
{1:8} Make yi mone as a virgin doth, yt gyrdeth her selfe with sacke, because of hir bryde grome.
{1:9} For the meate & drynkofferynge shalbe taken awaye from the house of the LORDE: & the prestes ye LORDES ministers shal mourne.
{1:10} The felde shalbe waisted, the londe shalbe in a miserable case: for the corne shalbe destroyed, the swete wyne shal come to confucion, & the oyle vtterly desolate.
{1:11} The husbodemen & the wyne gardeners shal loke piteously & make lamentacion, for the wheate wyne & barley, & because the haruest vpon the felde is so clene destroyed.
{1:12} The grape gatherers shal make greate mone, when the vynyarde & fygetrees be so vtterly waisted. Yee all the pomgarnettes, palmtrees, apletrees, & the other trees of the felde shall wyther awaye. Thus the mery cheare of the children of men, shal come to confucion.
{1:13} Gyrde you, & make yor mone, o ye prestes: mourne ye ministres of the aulter: go youre waye in, & slepe in sack cloth, o ye officers of my God: for the meat & drynkofferynge shalbe taken awaye from the house of yor God.
{1:14} Proclame a fastynge, call the cogregacion, gather the elders & all the inhabiters of the londe together into the house of the LORDE yor God, & crie vnto the LORDE:
{1:15} alas, alas for this daye. And why? the daye of the LORDE is at honde, and commeth as a destroyer from the Allmightie.
{1:16} Shal not ye meates be taken awaye before oure eyes, the myrth also & ioye from the house of oure God?
{1:17} The sede shal perish in the grounde, the garners shall lye waist, the floores shalbe broken downe, for the corne shalbe destroied.
{1:18} O what a sighinge make the catell? the bullockes are very euel likynge, because they haue no pasture: and the shepe are famesshed awaye.
{1:19} O LORDE, to the will I crie: for the fyre hath consumed the goodly pastures of the wyldernesse, and the flame hath brent vp all the trees of the felde.
{1:20} Yee the wylde beestes crie also vnto the: for the water ryuers are dryed vp, and the fyre hath consumed the pastures of the wyldernesse.
{2:1} Blowe out ye trompet in Sion, & crie vpo my holy hill, yt all soch as dwel in the londe, maye treble at it: for ye daie of the LORDE commeth, & is harde at honde:
{2:2} a darcke daye, a gloomynge daye, a cloudy daye, yee & a stormy daye, like as the mornynge spredeth out vpo the hilles: Namely, a great & mightie people: soch as haue not bene sens ye begynnynge, nether shal be after them for euermore.
{2:3} Before him shal be a consumynge fyre, & behynde him a burnynge flame. The londe shal be as a garden of pleasure before him, but behinde him shal it be a very waist wildernesse, & there is no man, that shal escape him.
{2:4} They are to loke vpon like bayrded horses, & runne like horse men.
{2:5} They skyppe vp vpon ye hilles, as it were the sounde of charettes: as the flame of fyre that consumeth the strawe, and as a mightie people redy to the batell.
{2:6} The folke shalbe afrayed of him, all faces shal be as blacke as a pot.
{2:7} These shal rune like giauntes, & leape ouer the walles like men of warre. Euery ma in his goinge shal kepe his araie, & not go out of his Path.
{2:8} There shal not one dryue another, but ech shal kepe his owne waye. They shal breake in at the wyndowes, & not be hurte:
{2:9} They shal come into the cite, & runne vpon the walles: They shal clymme vp vpon the houses, & slyppe in at the wyndowes like a thefe.
{2:10} The earth shal quake before him, yee the heauens shalbe moued: the Sonne & Moone shal be darckened, and the starres shal withdrawe their shyne.
{2:11} The LORDE shal shewe his voyce before his hoost, for his hoost is greate, stronge & mightie to fulfill his commaundement. This is yt greate and maruelous fearfull daye of the LORDE: And who is able to abyde it?
{2:12} Now therfore saieth the LORDE: Turne you vnto me with all youre hertes, with fastinge, wepynge and mournynge:
{2:13} rente youre hertes, & not youre clothes. Turne you vnto the LORDE youre God, for he is gracious & mercifull, longe sufferynge & of greate compassion: & redy to pardone wickednes.
{2:14} Then (no doute) he also shal turne, & forgeue: & after his chastenynge, he shal let youre increase remayne, for meat & drynck offerynges vnto the LORDE youre God?
{2:15} Blowe out with the tropet in Sion, proclame a fastynge, call the congregacion,
{2:16} & gather the people together: warne the congregacion, gather the elders, bringe the children & suclynges together. Let ye brydegrome go forth of his chabre, & the bryde out of her closet.
{2:17} Let the prestes serue the LORDE betwixte the porch & ye aulter, wepinge & sayenge: be fauourable (o LORDE) be fauourable vnto thy people: let not thine heretage be brought to soch confucion, lest the Heithen be lordes therof. Wherfore shulde they saye amonge the Heithen: where is now their God?
{2:18} Then shal the LORDE be gelous ouer his londe, & spare his people:
{2:19} yee ye LORDE shal answere, & saye vnto his people: Beholde, I wil sende you corne, wyne & oyle, so that ye shal haue plenty of them: & I wil nomore geue you ouer to be a reprofe amonge the Heithen.
{2:20} Agayne, as for him of the north, I shal dryue him farre from you: & shute him out in to a drye and waist londe, his face towarde the east see, and his hynder partes towarde the vttemost see. The stynke of him shall go vp, and his fylthy corrupcion shal fall vpon himself, because he hath dealte so proudly.
{2:21} Feare not (o londe) but be glad and reioyse, for the LORDE wil do greate thinges.
{2:22} Be not ye afrayed nether (o ye beastes of the felde) for the pastures shal be grene, and the trees shal beare their frute: the fygetrees & vinyardes shal geue their increase.
{2:23} Be glad then (o ye children of Sion) and reioyse in the LORDE youre God, for he hath geuen you the teacher of rightuousnes: & he it is yt shal sende you downe shuwers of rayne, early and late in the first moneth:
{2:24} so that ye garners shal be full of corne, and the presses plenteous in wyne and oyle.
{2:25} And as for the yeares that ye gresshopper, locuste, blasstinge & caterpiller (my greate hoost, which I sent amonge you) haue eaten vp, I shal restore them to you agayne:
{2:26} so that ye shal haue ynough to eate, and be satisfied: and prayse the name of the LORDE youre God, that so maruelously hath dealte with you. And my people shall neuer be confounded eny more:
{2:27} Ye shall well knowe, that I am in the myddest of Israel, and that I am youre God: yee and that there is none other, and my people shall nomore be brought to confucion.
{2:28} After this, will I poure out my sprete vpon all flesh: & yor sonnes & yor doughters shal prophecy: yor olde me shal dreame dreames & youre yonge men shal se visions:
{2:29} Yee in those dayes I will poure out my sprete vpon seruauntes and maydens.
{2:30} I will shewe wonders in heauen aboue, and tokes in the earth beneth: bloude and fyre, and the vapoure off smoke.
{2:31} The Sonne shalbe turned in to darcknesse, & ye Moone in to bloude: before yt greate & notable daye off the LORDE come.
{2:32} And the tyme shal come: yt who so euer calleth on the name of the LORDE, shalbe saued. For vpon the mount Sion & at Ierusalem, there shalbe a saluacion, like as the LORDE hath promised: yee & amonge the other remnaunt, whom the LORDE shall call.
{3:1} For take hede: In those dayes & at ye same tyme, when I turne agayne the captyuite of Iuda & Ierusale:
{3:2} I shal gather all people together, & brynge the in to the valley of Iosaphat: and there wil I reason with the, because of my people & heretage of Israel: who they haue scatred aboute in the nacions, & parted my lode:
{3:3} yee they haue cast lottes for my people, the yonge me haue they set in the brodel house, & solde the Damsels for wyne, yt they might haue to drike.
{3:4} Thou Tirus and Sido and all ye borders of the Philistynes: what haue ye to do with me? Will ye defye me? well: yf ye will nedes defye me, I shall recopence you, euen vpon youre heade, & yt right shortly:
{3:5} for ye haue take awaye my syluer & golde, my fayre & goodly Iewels, & brought them in to youre gods houses.
{3:6} The children also of Iuda and Ierusalem haue ye solde vnto the Grekes, that ye might brynge the farre fro ye borders of their owne countrees.
{3:7} Beholde therfore: I will rayse them out of the place, where ye haue solde them, & will rewarde you euen vpon youre heade.
{3:8} Youre sonnes & youre doughters will I sell thorow the hondes of the childre of Iuda, & so they shal geue them forth to sell, vnto the of Saba, a people of a farre coutre: for the LORDE himself hath sayde it.
{3:9} Crie out these thinges amonge the Gentiles, proclame warre, wake vp the giauntes, let them drawe nye, let the come vp all the lusty warryours of the.
{3:10} Make you sweardes of youre ploweshares, and speares of youre syckles & sythes. Let ye weake man saye: I am stronge.
{3:11} Mustre you, and come, all ye Heithe roude aboute: gather you together, there shall the LORDE laye all thy giauntes to the grounde.
{3:12} Let the people aryse, and get them to the valley of Iosaphat: for there wil I syt, and iudge all Heithe roude aboute.
{3:13} Laye to youre sythes, for the haruest is rype: come, get you downe: the wynepresse is full, yee the wynepresses runne ouer, for their wickednesse is waxen greate.
{3:14} In the valley appoynted, there shalbe many, many people: for the daye of the LORDE is nye in ye valley appoynted.
{3:15} The Sonne and Moone shall be darckened, & the starres shal withdrawe their light.
{3:16} The LORDE shal roare out of Sion, & crie out of Ierusale, that the heauens & the earth shal quake withall. But the LORDE shal be a defence vnto his owne people, ad a refuge for the childre of Israel.
{3:17} Thus shal ye knowe, yt I the LORDE youre God dwell vpo my holy mount of Sion. Then shal Ierusale be holy, & there shal no straungers go thorow her eny more.
{3:18} Then shal the moutaynes droppe swete wyne, & the hylles shall flowe with mylcke, All the ryuers of Iuda shal haue water ynough, & out of the LORDES house, there shal flowe a sprynge, to water ye broke of Sitim:
{3:19} but Egipte shalbe layed waist, & Edo shal be desolate: because they haue dealte so cruelly with the childre of Iuda, and shed innocent bloude in their londe.
{3:20} Agayne, Iuda shalbe inhabited for euermore, & Ierusale from generacion to generacio:
{3:21} for I wil not leaue their bloude vnauenged. And the LORDE shal dwell in Sion.

{1:1} The reuelacion of Iesus Christ, which God gaue vnto him, for to shewe vnto his seruautes thiges which muste shortly come to passe. And he sent and shewed by his angel vnto his seruaunt Ihon
{1:2} which bare recorde of the worde of God, and of the testimony of Iesus Christe, and of all thinges that he sawe.
{1:3} Happy is he yt readeth, and they that heare the wordes of the prophesy and kepe thoo thinges which are wrytten therin. For the tyme is at honde.
{1:4} Ihon to the seuen cogregacions in Asia. Grace be with you & peace, fro him which is and which was, and which is to come, & fro the seuen spretes which are present before his trone,
{1:5} and from Iesus Christ which is a faithfull witnes, and first begotten of the deed: & LORDE ouer ye kinges of the earth. Vnto him that loued vs and wesshed vs fro synnes in his awne bloud,
{1:6} and made vs kinges & Prestes vnto God his father, be glory, and dominion for euer more. Amen.
{1:7} Beholde, he commeth with cloudes, and all eyes shall se him: & they also which peersed him. And all kinredes of the earth shal wayle. Euen so. Amen.
{1:8} I am Alpha and Omega, the begynninge and the endinge, sayteh ye LORDE almighty, which is and which was and which is to come.
{1:9} I Ihon youre brother and copanyon in tribulacion, and in the kyngdome and paciece which is in Iesu Christe, was in the yle of Pathmos for the worde of God, and for ye witnessynge of Iesu Christe.
{1:10} I was in the sprete on a sondaye, and herde behynde me, a gret voyce, as it had bene of a trompe,
{1:11} sayenge: I am Alpha and Omega, the fyrst and ye laste. That thou seist, write in a boke, and sende it vnto the cogregacions which are in Asia, vnto Ephesus and vnto Smyrna, and vnto Pargamos, and vnto Thiatira, and vnto Sardis, and vnto Philadelphia, and vnto Laodicia.
{1:12} And I turned backe to se the voyce that spake to me. And whe I was turned: I sawe seue golde candestyckes,
{1:13} and in the myddes of the candelstyckes, one like vnto the sonne of man clothed with a lynnin garmet downe to the ground, and gyrd aboute the brest with a golden gyrdle.
{1:14} His heed, and his heares were whyte, as whyte woll, & as snowe: and his eyes were as a flamme of fyre:
{1:15} and his fete like vnto brasse, as though they bret in a fornace: and his voyce as the sounde of many waters.
{1:16} And he had in his right honde seue starres. And out of his mouth went a sharpe two edged swearde. And his face shone euen as the sonne in his strength.
{1:17} And when I sawe him, I fell at his fete, euen as deed. And he layde his right honde vpon me, sayenge vnto me: feare not. I am the fyrst, and the laste,
{1:18} and am alyue, and was deed. And beholde, I am alyue for euer more and haue the kayes of hell & of deth.
{1:19} Wryte therfore the thinges which thou hast sene, and the thinges which are, and ye thinges which shalbe fulfylled here after:
{1:20} & the mistery of the seuen starres which thou sawest in my right honde, and the seuen golden candelstickes. The seuen starres are the angels of the seue congregacions: And the seuen candelstyckes which thou sawest, are the seuen congregacions.
{2:1} Vnto the angell of the congregacion of Ephesus wryte: These thinges sayth he that holdeth the seuen starres in his righthonde, and walketh in the myddes of the seuen golde candelstickes:
{2:2} I knowe thy workes, and thy labour, and thy pacience, & howe thou cannest not forbeare them which are euell: and examinest them which saye they are Apostles, and are not: & hast founde the lyars
{2:3} and hast suffred. And hast paciece: and for my names sake hast laboured and hast not faynted.
{2:4} Neuerthelesse I haue somwhat agaynst the, for thou hast lefte thy fyrst loue.
{2:5} Remember therfore fro whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the fyrst workes. Or elles I wyl come vnto the shortly, and wil remoue thy cadelstycke out of his place, excepte thou repent.
{2:6} But this thou hast because thou hatest ye dedes of the Nicolaitans, which dedes I also hate.
{2:7} Let him yt hath eares, heare, what ye sprete saith vnto the congregacions. To him that ouercommeth, will I geue to eate of the tree of life, which is in the myddes of ye paradise of God.
{2:8} And vnto the angell of the congregacion of Smyrna wryte: These thinges saith he that is fyrst, and the last, which was deed, and is aliue:
{2:9} I knowe thy workes and tribulacion and pouerte, but thou art ryche: And I knowe the blaspheny of them which call them selues Iewes and are not: but are the cogregacion of Sathan.
{2:10} Feare none of tho thinges which thou shalt soffre. Beholde, ye deuell shal cast of you in to preson, to tempte you, and ye shal haue tribulacion x. dayes. Be faithfull vnto the deeth, and I wil geue ye a crowne of life.
{2:11} Let him that hath ears, heare, what the sprete saith to the congregacions: He that ouercometh, shal not be hurte of the seconde deeth.
{2:12} And to the angell of the congregacion in Pergamos wryte: This sayth he which hath the sharpe swearde with two edges:
{2:13} I knowe thy workes, and where thou dwellest, euen where Sathans seat is, and thou kepest my name, & hast not denyed my faith. And in my dayes Antipas was a faithfull witnes of myne, which was slayne amonge you, where Sathan dwelleth.
{2:14} But I haue a fewe thinges agaynst the: that thou hast there, the that manyntayne the doctryne of Balaam, which taught in Balak, to put occasion of syn before the children of Israell, that they shulde eate of meate dedicat vnto ydoles, and to commyt fornicacion.
{2:15} Euen so hast thou them that mayntayne ye doctryne of the Nicolaytans, which thinge I hate.
{2:16} But be couerted, or elles I wil come vnto the shortly, and wil fight agaynste the with the swearde of my mouth.
{2:17} Let him yt hath eares, heare, what the sprete saith vnto the cogregacions: To him that ouercommeth, wil I geue to eate mana that is hyd, and wil geue him a whyte stone, & in the stone a newe name wrytte, which no man knoweth, sauinge he that receaueth it.
{2:18} And vnto the angell of the cogregacion of Theatira write: This saith the sonne of God, which hath his eyes lyke vnto a flame of fyre, whose fete are like brasse:
{2:19} I knowe thy workes and thy loue, seruice, and faith and thy pacience, and thy dedes, which are mo at the last then at the firste
{2:20} Not withstondinge I haue a feawe thinges agaynst the, that thou sufferest that woman Iesabell (which called her selfe a prophetisse) to teache and to deceaue my seruauntes, to make them committ fornicacion, and to eate meates offered vp vnto ydoles.
{2:21} And I gaue her space to repet of her fornicacion, and she repented not.
{2:22} Beholde, I wil cast her into a bed, and them that commit fornicacion with her, in to gret aduersite, excepte they turne from their dedes.
{2:23} And I wil kyll her childre with deeth. And all the cogregacios shal knowe, yt I am he which searcheth the reynes and hertes. And I wil geue vnto euery one of you acordynge vnto youre workes.
{2:24} Vnto you I saye, and vnto other of the of Thiatyra, as many as haue not this lernynge and which haue not knowen the depnes of Sathan (as they saye) I wil put vpo you none other burthen,
{2:25} but yt which ye haue already. Holde fast tyll I come,
{2:26} and whosoeuer ouercometh and kepeth my workes vnto ye ende, to him wil I geue power ouer nacions,
{2:27} and he shal rule them with a rodde of yron: and as the vessels of a potter, shal he breake them to sheuers. Eue as I receaued of my father,
{2:28} so wil I geue him ye mornynge starre.
{2:29} Let him yt hath eares, heare, what the sprete sayth to the cogregacions.
{3:1} And wryte vnto the angell of the congregacion off Sardis: this sayth he that hath the seuen spretes of God, & the seuen starres. I knowe thy workes, thou hast a name that thou lyuest, and thou art deed.
{3:2} Be awake, and strength the thinges which remayne, that are redy to dye. For I haue not founde thy workes perfecte before God.
{3:3} Remember therfore how thou hast receaued and hearde, and holde fast, and repent. Yf thou shalt not watche, I wil come on the as a thefe, and thou shalt not knowe what houre I wil come vpon ye
{3:4} Thou hast a fewe names in Sardis, which haue not defyled their garmentes: and they shal walke with me in whyte, for they are worthy.
{3:5} He that ouercommeth, shalbe clothed in whyte araye, and I wil not put out his name out of the boke of life, and I wil cofesse his name before my father, and before his angels.
{3:6} Let him yt hath eares, heare, what the sprete sayth vnto the congregacions.
{3:7} And wryte vnto ye angell of the cogregacio of Philadelphia: this sayth he yt is holy and true, which hath the keye of Dauid: which openyth and noman shutteth, and shutteth and no man openeth.
{3:8} I knowe thy workes. Beholde, I haue set before the an open doore, and no man can shut it, for thou hast a lyttell strength and hast not denyed my name.
{3:9} Beholde, I shal geue some of the congregacion of Sathan, which call them selues Iewes and are not, but do lye: Beholde: I wil make them, that they shal come & worshippe before thy fete: and shal knowe that I haue loued the.
{3:10} Because thou hast kept the wordes of my pacience, therfore wil I kepe the from the houre of temptacion, which will come vpon all the worlde, to tempte them that dwell vpo the earth.
{3:11} Beholde, I come shortly. Holde that which thou hast, that no ma take awaye thy crowne.
{3:12} Him that ouer commeth, will I make a pyllar in the temple of my God, and he shal goo no more out.And I will wryte vpon him, the name of my God, and the name of ye cite of my God, newe Ierusalem, which cometh downe out of heauen from my God, and I will wryte vpo him my newe name.
{3:13} Let him that hath eares, heare, what the sprete saith vnto the congregacions.
{3:14} And vnto the angell of the cogregacion, which is in Laodicia wryte: This sayth Amen the faithfull and true witnes, the begynnynge of ye creatures of God.
{3:15} I knowe thy workes, yt thou art nether colde nor hot: I wolde thou were colde or hote.
{3:16} So then because thou art bitwene bothe, and nether colde ner hote I wyll spew the out off my mouth:
{3:17} because thou saist thou art riche and incresyd with goodes and hast nede of nothinge, and knowest not how thou art wretched & miserable, poore, blynde, and nakyd.
{3:18} I counsell the to bye of me golde tryed in the fyre, that thou mayste be riche: and whyte rayment, that thou mayste be clothed, that thy fylthy nakednes do not apere: anoynt thine eyes with eye salue, yt thou mayste se.
{3:19} As many as I loue, I rebuke & chasten. Be feruent therfore and repent.
{3:20} Beholde, I stonde at the doore & knocke. Yf eny man heare my voyce and vpen the dore, I wil come in vnto him and will suppe with him, & he with me.
{3:21} To him that ouercomth, will I graute to sytt with me on my seate, eue as I ouercam and haue sytte with my father on his seate.
{3:22} Let him that hath eares, heare, what the sprete saith vnto the cogregacios.
{4:1} After this I loked, and beholde, a dore was open in heaue, and the fyrste voyce which I harde, was as it were of a trompet talkinge with me, which sayde: come vp hydder, and I wil shewe the thinges which must be fulfylled her after.
{4:2} And immediatly I was in the sprete: & beholde, a seate was set in heauen, and one sat on the seate.
{4:3} And he that sat, was to loke vpon like vnto a iaspar stone, and a sardyne stone: And there was a rayne bowe aboute the seate, in syght like to a Smaragde.
{4:4} And aboute the seate were xxiiij. seates. And vpon the seates xxiiij. elders syttinge clothed in whyte rayment, and had on their heades crownes of golde.
{4:5} And out of ye seate proceded lightnynges, and thundrynges, & voyces, and there wer seuen lapes of fyre, burninge before the seate, which are the seuen spretes of God.
{4:6} And before the seate there was a see of glasse like vnto crystall, and in the mydes off the seate, and rounde aboute the seate, were foure beastes full of eyes before and behynde.
{4:7} And the first beest was like a lion, the seconde beest like a calfe, and the thyrde beest had a face as a man and the fourth beest was like a flyenge egle.
{4:8} And the foure beestes had eche one off them vj. wynges aboute him, and they were full of eyes with in. And they had no rest daye nether night, sayenge: holy, holy, holy, is the LORDE God almyghty, which was, and is, and is to come.
{4:9} And when those beestes gaue glory and honour and thankes to him that sat on the seate, which lyueth for euer and euer:
{4:10} ye xxiiij. elders fell downe before him that sat on the trone, and worshipped him yt lyueth for euer, and cast their crounes before ye trone, sayenge:
{4:11} thou art worthy LORDE to receaue glory, and honor, and power, for thou hast created all thinges, and for thy willes sake they are, and were created.
{5:1} And I sawe in the right hode of him, that sat in the trone, a boke wrytten with in & on the backside, sealed with seue seales.
{5:2} And I sawe a stroge angell preachinge with a loude voyce: Who is worthy to open the boke, and to loose the seales therof?
{5:3} And no ma in heaue ner in earth, nether vnder ye earth, was able to ope ye boke, nether to loke thereon.
{5:4} And I wepte moch, because no man was founde worthy to open and to rede the boke, nether to loke thereon.
{5:5} And one of the elders sayde vnto me: wepe not: Beholde, the lyon which is off the trybe of Iuda, ye rote of Dauid, hath obtayned to ope the boke, and to lowse the seue seales therof.
{5:6} And I behelde, & lo, in the myddes of the seate, and of ye foure beastes, and in the myddes of ye elders, stode a lambe as though he had bene kylled, which had seuen hornes and seue eyes, which are the seue spretes of God, sent in to all the worlde.
{5:7} And he came and toke the boke out of the right hode of him that sat vpon the seate.
{5:8} And when he had taken the boke, the foure beestes and the xxiiij. elders fell downe before the lambe, hauinge harpes and golden vialles full of odoures (which are ye prayers of the sayntes)
{5:9} and they songe a newe songe saynge: thou art worthy to take the boke & to ope the seales therof: for thou wast kylled, and hast redemed vs by thy bloud, out of all kynreddes, and toges, and people, and nacions,
{5:10} & hast made vs vnto or God, kynges and prestes, and we shal raygne on ye earth.
{5:11} And I behelde, and I herd the voyce of many angilles aboute the trone, and aboute the beestes and ye elders, and I herde thousand thousandes,
{5:12} sayenge with a loude voyce: Worthy is the lambe that was killed, to receaue power, and riches & wissdome, and strength, and honoure and glory, and blessynge.
{5:13} And all creatures, which are in heaue, & on the earth, & vnder the earth, & in the see, & all yt are in the, herd I sayenge: blessinge, honoure, glory, & power, be vnto him, yt sytteth vpo the seate, and vnto the labe for euermore.
{5:14} And the foure beestes saide: Ame. And ye xxiiij. elders fell vpon their faces, and worshipped him that lyueth for euermore.
{6:1} And I sawe when the labe opened one of the seales, & I herde one of the foure beestes saye, as it wer the noyse off thonder: come and se.
{6:2} And I sawe, and beholde there was a whyte horsse, and he yt sat on him had a bowe, and a crowne was geuen vnto him, and he went forth conquerynge and for to ouercome.
{6:3} And whe he opened the seconde seale, I herde the seconde beeste saye: come and se.
{6:4} And there went out another horsse that was reed, & power was geuen to him that sat there on, to take peace from the earth, and that they shulde kyll one another. And there was geue vnto him a gret swearde.
{6:5} And when he opened the thyrde seale, I herde the thyrde beeste saye: come & se. And I behelde, and lo, a blacke horsse: and he that sate on him, had a payre of balances in his honde.
{6:6} And I herde a voyce in the myddes of the foure beastes saye: a measure of whete for a peny, and thre measures of barly for a peny: and oyle and wyne se thou hurte not.
{6:7} And when he opened the fourth seale, I herde the voyce of the fourthe beaste saye: come and se.
{6:8} And I loked, and beholde a pale horsse, and his name that sat on him was deeth, and hell folowed after him, & power was geue vnto them ouer the fourthe parte of the earth, to kyll with swearde, and wt honger, and with deeth, of the vermen of the earth.
{6:9} And when he opened the fyfte seale, I sawe vnder the aultre, the soules of them yt were kylled for the worde of God, and for ye testimony which they had,
{6:10} and they cryed with a lowde voyce sayege: How loge tariest thou LORDE holy and true, to iudge & to auenge oure bloude on them that dwell on the earth?
{6:11} And longe whyte garmentes were geuen vnto euery one of them. And it was sayde vnto them, that they shulde reste for a lyttle season, vntyll the nomber of their felowes, and brethre, and of them that shulde be killed as they were, were fulfilled.
{6:12} And I behelde when he opened the sixte seale, and loo, there was a grett earthquake, and ye sonne was as blacke as sacke cloth made of heare. And the mone wexed eue as bloude:
{6:13} and the starres of heauen fell vnto the earth, euen as a fygge tree castith from her her fygges, when she is shaken off a mighty wynde.
{6:14} And heauen vanysshed awaye, as a scroll when it is rolled togedder. And all mountayns and yles, were moued out of their places.
{6:15} And the kynges of ye earth, and the grete men, and the riche men, and the chefe captaynes, and the myghte men, and euery free man, hyd them selues in dennes, and in rockes of ye hylles,
{6:16} and sayde to the hylles, and rockes: fall on vs, and hyde vs from the presence of him that sytteth on the seate, and from the wrath of the lambe,
{6:17} for the grete daye of his wrath is come. And who can endure it?
{7:1} And after that sawe I foure angels stode on ye foure corners of the earth, holdinge ye foure wyndes of ye earth, yt ye wyndes shulde not blowe on ye earth, nether on ye see, nether on eny tree.
{7:2} And I sawe another angel ascende fro the rysinge of the sonne: which had the seale of ye lyuinge God and he cryed with a loude voyce to the foure angelles (to whom power was geuen to hurt the earth and the see)
{7:3} sayenge: Hurt not the earth nether the see, nether the trees, till we haue sealed the seruautes of oure God in their forheddes.
{7:4} And I herde the nombre of them which were sealed, and there were sealed an c. and xliiij. M. of all the trybes of the children of Israell.
{7:5} Of ye trybe of Iuda were sealed xij. M. Of the trybe of Ruben were sealed xij. M. Of the trybe of Gad were sealed xij. M.
{7:6} Of the trybe of Asser were sealed xij. M. Of the trybe of Neptalym were sealed xij. M. Of ye trybe of Manasses were sealed xij. M.
{7:7} Of the trybe of Symeon were sealed xij. M. Of the trybe of Leui were sealed xij. M. Of the trybe of Isacar were sealed xij. M.
{7:8} Of the trybe of Zabulon were sealed xij. M. Of the trybe of Ioseph were sealed xij. M. Of the trybe of Beniamin were sealed xij. thousande.
{7:9} After this I behelde, and lo, a gret multitude (which no man coulde nombre) of all nacions and people, and tonges, stode before the seate, and before the lambe, clothed wt longe whyte garmetes, and palmes in their hondes,
{7:10} and cryed with a loude voyce, sayenge: saluacion be asscribed to him yt sytteth vpon the seate of oure God, and vnto the lambe.
{7:11} And all the angels stode in the compase of the seate, and of the elders and of the foure beastes, and fell before ye seat on their faces, and worshipped God,
{7:12} sayenge, amen: Blessynge and glory, wissdome and thakes, and honour, and power and might, be vnto oure God for euermore Amen.
{7:13} And one of the elders answered, sayenge vnto me: what are these which are arayed in longe whyte garmetes, and whence cam they?
{7:14} And I sayde vnto him: LORDE thou wotest. And he sayde vnto me: these are they which cam out of gret tribulacion, and made their garmentes large, and made the whyte in the bloude of the lambe:
{7:15} therfore are they in the presence of the seate of God and serue him daye and night in his temple, and he that sytteth in the seate, wyll dwell amonge them.
{7:16} They shal honger nomore nether thyrst, nether shal the sonne lyght on them, nether eny heate:
{7:17} For the labe which is in the myddes of the seate, shal fede them, and shal leade them vnto fountaynes of lyuynge water, and God shal wype awaye all teares from their eyes.
{8:1} And when he had opened the seuenth seale, there was silece in heauen aboute the space of halfe an houre.
{8:2} And I sawe seue angels stondinge before God, and to them were geuen seuen trompettes.
{8:3} And another angell cam and stode before the aultre, hauynge a golden senser, and moch of odoures was geuen vnto him, that he shulde offre of the prayers of all sayntes vpon the golden aultre, which was before the seate.
{8:4} And the smoke of the odoures which came of the prayers of all sayntes, ascended vppe before God out of the angelles honde.
{8:5} And the angell toke the senser, and fylled it with fyre of the aultre, and caste it into the earth, and voyces were made, and thodrynges and lightnynges, and earthquake.
{8:6} And the seuen angels which had the seuen trompettes, prepared them selues to blowe.
{8:7} The first angel blewe, and there was made hayle and fyre, which were myngled with bloud, & they were cast in to the earth: and the thyrd parte of trees was burnt, and all grene grasse was brent.
{8:8} And the seconde angell blewe: and as it were a greate mountayne burnynge with fyre was cast in to the see, and the thyrde parte of the see turned to bloud,
{8:9} and the thyrde parte of the creatures which had life, dyed, and the thyrde part of shippes were destroyed.
{8:10} And the thyrde angell blewe, and there fell a greate starre from heauen, burnynge as it were a lampe, and it fell in to the thyrde parte of the ryuers, and in to fountaynes of waters,
{8:11} and the name of the starre is called Wormwod. And the thyrde parte of the waters was turned to Wormwod. And many men dyed of the waters, because they were made bytter.
{8:12} And the fourth angel blew, and the thyrde parte of ye Sonne was smytten, and ye thyrde parte of the mone, & the thyrde parte of starres: so that the thyrde parte of them was darckned. And the daye was smytte, that the thyrde parte of it shulde not shyne, and lyke wyse the nyght.
{8:13} And I behelde, and herde an angel flyenge thorowe the myddes of heaue, and sayege with a lowde voyce: Wo, wo, wo to the inhabiters of the earth, because of the voyces to come of the trompe of the thre angels which were yet to blowe.
{9:1} And the fyfte angell blewe, & I sawe a starre fall from heaue vnto ye earth. And to him was geue the kaye of the bottomlesse pytt.
{9:2} And he opened the bottomlesse pytt, and there arose the smoke of a greate fornace. And the Sonne, and ye ayer were darkned by the reason of the smoke of the pytt.
{9:3} And there came out of the smoke locustes vpon the earth: and vnto the was geuen power as the scorpions of the earth haue power.
{9:4} And it was sayde vnto them, that they shulde not hurt the grasse of the earth: nether eny grene thinge: nether eny tre: but onely those men which haue not the seale in their forhedes,
{9:5} and to them was comaunded, that they shulde not kyll the, but that they shulde be vexed fyue monethes, and their payne was as the payne that cometh of a scorpion, when he hath stonge a man.
{9:6} And in those dayes shal me seke deeth, and shal not fynde it: and shal desyre to dye, and death shal flye from them.
{9:7} And the similitude of the locustes was lyke vnto horses prepared vnto battayll, and on their heades were as it were crownes, lyke vnto golde: and their faces were as it had bene the faces of men.
{9:8} And they had heere as the heere of wemen. And their tethe were as the tethe of lyons.
{9:9} And they had habbergions, as it were habbergions of yron. And the sounde of their wynges, was as ye sounde of charettes whe many horsses runne together to battayle.
{9:10} And they had tayles lyke vnto scorpions, and there were stynges in their tayles. And their power was to hurt me fyue monethes.
{9:11} And they had a kinge ouer them, which is the angel of the bottomlesse pyt, whose name in the hebrew tonge, is Abadon: but in the greke tonge, Apollion.
{9:12} One wo is past, and beholde two woes come yet after this.
{9:13} And the sixte angel blewe, and I herde a voyce from the foure corners of the golden aultre which is before God,
{9:14} sayenge to the sixte angel, which had the trompe: Lowse the foure angels, which are bounde in the greate ryuer Eufrates.
{9:15} And ye foure angels were lowsed, which were prepared for an houre, for a daye, for a moneth, and for a yeare, for to slee the thyrde parte of men.
{9:16} And the nombre of horsmen of warre, were twenty tymes x M. And I herde ye nombre of them.
{9:17} And thus I sawe the horses in a vision, and them that sat on the hauynge fyry habbergions of a yalowe and brymstony color, and the heades of ye horses werre as the heades of lyons. And out of their mouthes went forth fyre, and smoke, and brymstone.
{9:18} And of these thre was the thirde parte of men kylled: that is to saye, of fyre, smoke, and brymstone, which proceded out of the mouthes of the:
{9:19} For their power was in their mouthes and in their tayles: for their tayles were like vnto serpetes, and had heades, and with the they dyd hurt:
{9:20} And the remnaunt of the me which were not kylled by these plages, repeted not of the dedes of their hondes, yt they shulde not worshippe deuels, and ymages of golde, and syluer, and brasse, & stone, and of wod, which nether can se, nether heare, nether go.
{9:21} Also they repented not of their murthur, and of their witchcraft, nether of their whordome, nether of their thefte.
{10:1} And I sawe another mightye angell come doune fro heauen, clothed with a cloude, and the rayne bowe vpon his heed. And his face as it were ye Sonne, and his fete as it were pyllars of fyre:
{10:2} and he had in his honde a lytell boke opyn: and he put his right fote vpon ye see, and his lifte fote on ye earth.
{10:3} And cryed with a lowde voyce, as when a lyon roreth. And when he had cryed, seue thondres spake their voyces.
{10:4} And when the seue thodres had spoke their voyces, I was aboute to wryte. And I herde a voyce from heauen sayenge vnto me: seale vp those thinges which the seuen thondres spake, and wryte them not.
{10:5} And the angel which I sawe stonde vpo the see, and vpon the earth, lifte vppe his honde to heauen,
{10:6} and swore by him that liueth for euermore, which created heauen, and the thinges that there in are, and ye see, and the thinges which are therin: that there shalbe nomore tyme:
{10:7} but in the dayes of the voyce of the seueth angel, when he shal begynne to blowe, the mistery of God shalbe fynisshed, as he preached by his seruauntes the prophetes.
{10:8} And the voyce which I herde from heaue, spake vnto me agayne, and sayde: go and take the lytle boke which is open in the honde of the angel, which stondeth vpo the see, and vpon the earth.
{10:9} And I went vnto the angel, and sayde vnto him: geue me the lytle boke. And he sayde vnto me: Take it, and eate it vp, and it shal make thy belly bytter, but it shalbe in thy mouth as swete as hony.
{10:10} And I toke the lytle boke out of his honde, and ate it vp, and it was in my mouth as swete as hony, and as sone as I had eaten it, my belly was bytter.
{10:11} And he sayde vnto me: thou muste prophesy agayne vnto the people, and to the Heythen, and tonges, and to many kynges.
{11:1} And there was geuen me a rede lyke vnto a rodd, and it was sayde vnto me: Ryse and mete the teple of God, and the aultre, and them that worshippe therin:
{11:2} and the quyre which is within the temple, cast out, and mete it not: for it is geuen vnto the Gentyles, and ye holy cite shal they treade vnderfote xlij. monethes.
{11:3} And I wil geue power vnto my two wytnesses, and they shal prophesy .M.ijc. and lx. dayes clothed in sacke cloth.
{11:4} These are two olyue trees, and two candelstyckes, stondinge before the God of the earth.
{11:5} And if eny man wil hurt them, fyre shal procede out of their mouthes, and consume their enemyes. And yf eny ma wil hurt the, this wyse muste he be kylled.
{11:6} These haue power to shut heauen, that it rayne not in the dayes of their prophesyinge: and haue power ouer waters, to turne them to bloud, and to smyte the earth with all maner plages, as often as they will.
{11:7} And when they haue fynisshed their testimony, the beest that cam out of the bottomlesse pytt, shal make warre agaynst the, and shal ouer come them, and kyll the.
{11:8} And their bodies shal lye in the stretes of the greate cite, which spiritually is called zodom and Egypte, where oure LORDE is crucified.
{11:9} And some of the people and kynredes, and tonges, & of the nacios, shal se their bodies, thre dayes, and an halfe, and shal not suffre their bodies to be put in graues.
{11:10} And they that dwell vpo the earth, shal reioyce ouer them and be glad, and shal send giftes one to another: for these two prophetes vexed them that dwelt on the earth.
{11:11} And after thre dayes and an halfe the sprete of life from God, entred in to them. And they stode vp vpon their fete: & greate feare came vpon them which sawe them.
{11:12} And they herde a greate voyce from heaue, sayenge vnto them: Come vp hidder. And they ascended vp in to heaue in a cloude, and their enemyes sawe the.
{11:13} And the same houre was there a greate earthquake, & the tenth parte of the cite fell, and in the earthquake were slayne names of men seuen M. and the remnaunt were feared, and gaue glory to God of heauen.
{11:14} The seconde wo is past, and beholde, the thyrd wo wyl come anone.
{11:15} And the seuenth angel blewe, and ther were made greate voyces in heauen, sayege: the kyngdoms of this worlde are oure LORDES and his Christes, and he shal reigne for eurmore.
{11:16} And the foure and twentye Elders, which sat before God on their seatts, fell vpon their faces, and worshipped God
{11:17} sayenge: we geue the thankes LORDE God allmyghte: which art and wast, and art to come, for thou hast receaued thy greate might, and hast raygned.
{11:18} And the Heythen were angry, & thy wrath is come, and the tyme of the deed that they shulde be iudged, and that thou shuldest geue rewarde vnto thy seruautes the prophettes and saynctes, and to the that feare thy name, small & greate: and shuldest destroye them which destroye the earth.
{11:19} And the temple of God was opened in heauen, and there was sene in his temple the arcke of his testament: and there folowed lightnynges, and voyces, and thondrynges and earth quake, and a greate hayle.
{12:1} And there appeared a greate token in heauen. A woman clothed with the Sonne, and the mone vnder her fete, and vpon her heed a crowne of twolue starres.
{12:2} And she was with childe, and cryed trauaillinge in byrth, and payned redy to be delyuered.
{12:3} And there appeared another token in heauen, and beholde a greate reed dragon, hauinge seuen heades, and ten hornes and seue crownes vpo his heades:
{12:4} and his tayle drue the thyrde parte of the starres, and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stode before the woma, which was ready to be delyuered: for to devoure her childe as sone as it were borne.
{12:5} And she brought forth a man childe, which shulde rule all nacions with a rod of yron. And her sonne was taken vp vnto God, and to his seate.
{12:6} And the woman fled in to wyldernes, where she had a place prepared off God, that they shulde fede her there a M.ij.C. and lx. dayes.
{12:7} And there was a greate batayll in heaue Michael and his angels foughte with the dragon, and the dragon fought and his angels,
{12:8} and preuayled not, nether was their place founde eny more in heauen.
{12:9} And the greate dragon that olde serpent (called the deuell and Sathanas) was cast out. Which disceaued all the worlde. And he was cast in to the earth, and his angelles were cast out with him also.
{12:10} And I harde a lowde voyce, which sayde in heauen: Now is saluacion, and strength and the kyngdome become oure Gods, and ye power his Christes: For he is cast downe, which accused them before God daye and night.
{12:11} And they ouercame him by the bloude of the lambe, and by the worde of their testimony, and they loued not their lyues vnto the deeth.
{12:12} Therfore reioyce ye heauens, and ye that dwell in them. Wo to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the see: for the deuell is come downe vnto you, which hath greate wrath, because he knoweth, that he hath but a short tyme.
{12:13} And when the dragon sawe, that he was cast vnto the earth, he persecuted the woman, which brought forth the man childe.
{12:14} And to the woman were geue two wynges of a greate egle that she might flye in to the wyldernes, in to her place, where she is norysshed for a tyme, two tymes, and halffe a tyme, from the presence of the serpet.
{12:15} And the dragon cast out of his mouth water after the woma, as it had bene a ryuer, that he might cause her to be caught of ye floud.
{12:16} And the earth holpe the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swalowed vp the ryuer which the dragon cast out of his mouth.
{12:17} And the dragon was wroth with the woma: and went and made warre with the remnaunt of hyr sede, which kepe the comaundementes of God, and haue the testimony of Iesus Christ. And I stode on the see sonde.
{13:1} And I sawe a beest rise out of the see, hauinge seuen heades, and x. hornes, and vpon his hornes x. crownes, and vpo his heed, the names of blasphemy.
{13:2} And the beest which I sawe was lyke a catt of the mountayne, and his fete were as the fete of a bear, and his mouth as the mouthe of a lyon. And ye drago gaue him his power and his seate, and greate auctorite:
{13:3} and I sawe one of his heades as it were wounded to death, and his dedly wounde was healed. And all the worlde wodred at the beest,
{13:4} and they worshipped the dragon which gaue power vnto the beest, and they worshipped the beest, sayenge: who is like vnto the beest? who is able to warre with him?
{13:5} And there was geuen vnto him a mouth to speake greate thinges & blasphemies, and power was geuen vnto him, to do xlij. monethes.
{13:6} And he opened his mouth vnto blasphemy agaynst God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heauen.
{13:7} And it was geuen vnto him to make warre with the sayntes, and to ouercome them. And power was geuen him ouer all kynred, tonge, and nacion:
{13:8} and all that dwell vpon the earth worshipt him: whose names are not wrytten in the boke of life of the lambe, which was kylled from the beginnynge of the worlde.
{13:9} Yf eny man haue an eare, let him heare.
{13:10} He that leadeth in to captiuite, shal go in to captiuite: he that killeth with a swearde, must be killed with ye swearde. Heare is the pacience, and the faith of the saynctes.
{13:11} And I behelde another beest commynge vp out of the earth, and he had two hornes like a lambe, and he spake as dyd the drago.
{13:12} And he dyd all that the first beest coulde do in his presence, and he caused the earth, and them which dwell therin, to worshippe the fyrst beest, whose deedly woude was healed.
{13:13} And he dyd greate wonders, so that he made fyre come downe from heaue in the sight of men.
{13:14} And deceaued them that dwelt on the earth by ye meanes of those signes which he had power to do in the sight of the beest, sayenge to them that dwelt on the earth: that they shulde make an ymage vnto the beest, which had the wounde of a swearde and dyd liue.
{13:15} And he had power to geue a sprete vnto the ymage of the beest, and that the ymage of the beest shulde speake, and shulde cause, that as many as wolde not worshippe the ymage of the beest, shulde be kylled.
{13:16} And he made all bothe smale and greate, ryche and poore, fre and bond, to receaue a marke in their right hondes, or in their forheades.
{13:17} And that no man might by or sell, saue he yt had ye marke, or the name of the beest, ether the nombre of his name.
{13:18} Here is wissdome. Let him that hath wyt, count the nombre of the beest. For it is the nombre of a man, and his nombre is sixe hondred, thre score and sixe.
{14:1} And I loked, and lo, a lambe stode on the mout Syon, and with him .C. and xliiij. thousande hauynge his fathers name wrytten in their forheades.
{14:2} And I herde a voyce from heauen, as the sounde of many waters, and as the voyce of a greate thondre. And the voyce that I herde, was as the harpers that playe vpon their harpers.
{14:3} And they songe as it were a newe songe, before the seate, & before ye foure beestes, and the elders, and no man coulde learne yt songe, but the hondred and xliiij.M. which were redemed from the earth.
{14:4} These are they, which were not defyled with wemen, for they are virgyns. These folowe the lambe whither soeuer he goeth. These were redemed from men, beynge the fyrst frutes vnto God and to the lambe,
{14:5} and in their mouthes was founde no gyle. For they are withoute spot before the trone of God.
{14:6} And I sawe an angell flye in the myddes of heauen hauinge an euerlastinge Gospell, to preache vnto them that syt and dwell on the earth, and to all nacions, kinreddes, and toges and people,
{14:7} sayege with a lowde voyce: Feare God, and geue honour to him, for the houre of his iudgement is come: and worshippe him that made heauen and earth, and the see, and the fountaynes off water.
{14:8} And there folowed another angell, sayenge: She is fallen, she is fallen: eue Babilon that greate cite, for she made all nacions drynke off the wyne off hyr whordome.
{14:9} And the thyrde angel folowed the, sayenge with a loude voyce: Yf eny man worshippe the beest and his ymage, and receaue his marke in his forhed, or on his honde,
{14:10} the same shall drynke of the wyne of the wrath of God, which is powred in the cuppe of his wrath. And he shalbe punysshed in fyre and brymstone, before the holy Angels, and before the lambe.
{14:11} And the smoke of their torment ascendeth vp euermore. And they haue no rest daye ner nyght, which worshippe the beast and his ymage, and whosoeuer receaueth the prynt of his name.
{14:12} Here is the pacience of sayntes. Heare are they that kepe the commaundementes and the faith off Iesu.
{14:13} And I herde a voyce from heauen, sayenge vnto me: wryte: Blessed are ye deed, which here after dye in the LORDE. Yee the sprete sayeth, that they rest from their laboures, for their workes folowe them.
{14:14} And I loked and beholde, a whyte cloude, and vpo ye cloude one syttynge like vnto the sonne of man, hauinge on his heed a golden crowne, and in his hode a sharpe sykle.
{14:15} And another angell came out of the temple, cryenge with a loude voyce to him that sat on the cloude: Thruste in thy sycle and reepe: for the tyme is come to reepe, for the corne of the earth is rype.
{14:16} And he that sat on ye cloude thrust in his sykle on the earth, and the earth was reeped.
{14:17} And another angell came out of the temple, which is in heauen, hauinge also a sharpe sykle.
{14:18} And another angel came out from the aultre, which had power ouer fyre, and cryed with a loude crye vnto hym that had the sharpe syckle, and sayde: Thruste in thy sharpe syckle, and gather the clusters of ye earth, for hir grapes are rype.
{14:19} And the angell thrust in his syckle on the erthe, and cut downe the grapes of the vynyarde of the earth, and cast them in to the greate wynefat of ye wrath of God:
{14:20} & the wynefat was trodden without the cite, and bloude came out of the fat, euen vnto the horsse brydles by the space of a thousande and sixe hundreth furlonges.
{15:1} And I sawe another signe in heuen grett & mervellous .vii. angells havinge the seven laste plages, for in the is fulfylled the wrath of god.
{15:2} And I sawe as it were a glassye see, mingled with fyre, and them that had gotten victory of the beest, and of his ymage, and of his marke, and of the nombre of his name, stonde on the glassye see, hauinge ye harpes of God:
{15:3} and they songe the songe of Moses the seruaunt of God, and the songe of the lambe, saynge: Greate and maruellous are thy workes LORDE God almyghty, iust and true are thy wayes, thou kynge of sayntes.
{15:4} Who shal not feare the O LORDE and gloryfie thy name? For thou only art holy, for all getiles shall come and worshippe before the, for thy iudgmentes are made manyfest.
{15:5} And after that, I loked, and beholde, the temple of the Tabernacle of testimony was open in heauen,
{15:6} and the seuen angelles came out of the temple, which had the seuen plages, clothed in pure and bryght lynne, and hauynge their brestes gyrded with golden gerdelles.
{15:7} And one of the foure beestes gaue vnto the seuen angelles seuen golden vialles, full of the wrath of God which liueth for euermore.
{15:8} And the temple was full of smoke for the glory off God, and for his power, and no man was able to entre in to the temple, tyll the seuen plages of the seue angels were fulfilled.
{16:1} And I herde a greate voyce out of the temple, sayenge to the seuen angels: go youre wayes, poure out youre vialles of wrath vpon the earth.
{16:2} And the fyrst went, and poured out his viall vpon the earth, and there fell a noysom & a sore botch vpon the men which had the marke of the beest, and vpon them that worshipped his ymage.
{16:3} And the seconde angel shed out his viall vpo the see, and it turned as it were in to the bloud of a deed man: and euery lyuinge thinge dyed in the see,
{16:4} And the thyrde angel shed out his vyall vpon the ryuers and fountaynes of waters, and they turned to bloude.
{16:5} And I herde an angel saye: LORDE which art and wast, thou art righteous and holy, because thou hast geue soche iudgmentes,
{16:6} for they shed the bloude of sayntes, and prophetes, and therfore hast thou geuen them bloude to drynke: for they are worthy.
{16:7} And I herde another angell out of the aulter, saye: euen so LORDE God almighty, true and righteous are thy iudgmentes.
{16:8} And the fourth angell poured out his viall on the Sonne, and power was geuen vnto him to vexe men with heate of fyre.
{16:9} And the men raged in gret heate, and spake euell of the name of God, which had power ouer those plages, and they repented not, to geue him glory.
{16:10} And the fifte angell poured out his vyall vpon the seate of the beest, and his kyngdome wexed derke, and they gnewe their tonges for sorowe,
{16:11} and blasphemed the God of heaue for sorowe, and payne of their sores, and repented not of their dedes.
{16:12} And the sixte angell poured out his vyall vpon the gret ryuer Euphrates, and the water dryed vp, that the waye of the kynges of the Easte shulde be prepared.
{16:13} And I sawe thre vncleane spretes kike frogges come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out off the mouth off the beest, and out off the mouth of the false prophet.
{16:14} For they are the spretes of deuels workynge myracles, to go out vnto the kynges of the earth and of the whole worlde, to gaddre them to the battayle of that gret daye of God allmighty.
{16:15} Beholde, I come as a thefe. Happy is he that watcheth and kepeth his garmentes, lest he be founde naked, and men se his filthynes.
{16:16} And he gaddered them togedder in to a place, called in the hebrue tonge, Armagedon.
{16:17} And the seuenth angell poured out his viall in to the ayre. And there came a greate voyce out of heauen from the seate, sayenge: It is done.
{16:18} And there folowed voyces, thondringes, and lightnynges, and there was a gret earthquake, soch as was not sence me were vpon the earth, so myghty an earthquake and so greate.
{16:19} And the greate cite was deuyded in to thre parties. And the cities of nacions fell. And greate Babilon came in remembraunce before God, to geue vnto hyr the cuppe of wyne of the fearcenes of his wrath.
{16:20} And euery yle fled awaye, and the mountaynes were not founde.
{16:21} And there fell a greate hayle, as it had bene talentes, out of heaue vpon the men, and the men blasphemed God, because of the plage of the hayle, for it was greate, and the plage of it sore.
{17:1} And there cam one of the seue angels, which had the seuen vialles, and talked with me, sayenge vnto me: Come, I wil shewe the the iugdment of the greate whore, that sytteth vpon many waters,
{17:2} with whom the kynges of the earth haue commytted whordome, and the inhabiters of the earth are dronken with the wyne of her fornicacion.
{17:3} And he caryed me awaye into the wildernes in ye sprete. And I sawe a woman syt vpon a rose colored beest, full of names of blasphemie, which had seue heades & ten hornes.
{17:4} And ye woman was arayed in purple and rose color, and decked with golde, precious stone, and pearles, and had a cupp of golde in her honde, full of abhominacions, and fylthines of her wordome.
{17:5} And in her forhed was a name wrytte, a mistery; greate Babilon the mother of whordome, and abominacios of the earth.
{17:6} And I sawe the wyfe dronke with the bloude of sayntes, and with the bloud of the witnesses of Iesu. And when I sawe her, I wondred with greate mervayle.
{17:7} And the angell sayde vnto me: wherfore meruayllest thou? I wyl shewe the the mistery of the woman, and of the beest that beerith her, which hath seuen heades, and ten hornes.
{17:8} The beest that thou seest, was, and is not, and shall ascende out of the bottomlesse pytt, and shal go in to perdicion, and they that dwell on the earth shal wondre (whose names are not wrytten in the boke of life from the begynnynge of the worlde) when they beholde the beest that was, and is not.
{17:9} And here is a mynde, that hath wissdome. The seuen heades are seuen mountanes, on which the woman sytteth:
{17:10} they are also seuen kynges. Fyue are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come. When he commeth, he muste continue a space.
{17:11} And the beest that was, and is not, is eue the eyght, and is of the seuen, and shal go in to destruccion.
{17:12} And ye ten hornes which thou sawest, are ten kynges, which haue not yet receaued the kyngdome, but shal receaue power as kynges at one houre with ye beest.
{17:13} These haue one mynde, and shal geue their power and stregth vnto ye beeste.
{17:14} These shal fyght with the lambe, and the labe shal ouercome them: For he is LORDE of all lordes, and kinge of all kinges: and they that are on his syde, are called, and chosen and faithfull.
{17:15} And he saide vnto me: The waters which thou sawest, where ye whore sytteth, are people, and folke, and nacions, and tonges.
{17:16} And the ten hornes, which thou sawest vpon the beest, are they that shal hate the whore, and shal make her desolate, and naked, and shall eate hir flesshe, and burne her with fyre.
{17:17} For God hath put in their hertes, to fulfill his wyll, and to do with one consent, for to geue hir kyngdome vnto the beest, vntill the wordes of God be fulfylled.
{17:18} And the woma which thou sawest, is that greate cite, which raigneth ouer the kynges of the earth.
{18:1} And after that I sawe another angel come downe fro heaue, hauinge greate power, and ye earth was lyghtned with his bryghtnes.
{18:2} And he cryed mightely with a stronge voyce, sayenge: She is fallen, she is fallen, euen greate Babilon, and is become the habitacion of deuels, and ye holde of all fowle spretes, and a cage of all vncleane and hatefull byrdes:
{18:3} for all nacios haue dronken of the wyne of the wrath of her whordome. And the kynges of the earth haue committed fornicacion with her, and her marchauntes are wexed ryche of the abundaunce of her pleasures.
{18:4} And I herde another voyce from heauen saye: come awaye from her my people, that ye be not partakers of her synnes, lest ye receaue of her plages.
{18:5} For her synnes are gone vp to heauen, and the LORDE hath remembred her wyckednes.
{18:6} Rewarde her euen as she rewarded you, and geue her dubble acordinge to her workes. And poure in dubble to her in the same cuppe, which she fylled vnto you.
{18:7} And as moche as she gloryfied her selfe and lyued wantanly, so moch poure ye in for her of punysshmet, and sorowe, for she sayeth in her herte: I syt beinge a quene, and am no wyddowe, and shall se no sorowe.
{18:8} Therfore shal her plages come at one daye, death, and sorowe, and honger, and she shalbe bret with fyre: for stronge is the LORDE God which shal iudge her.
{18:9} And the kynges of the earth shal bewepe her and wayle ouer her, which haue committed fornicacion and lyued wantanly with her, when they shal se the smoke of her burnynge,
{18:10} and shal stonde a farre of for feare of her punysshment, sayenge: Alas, Alas, that greate cite Babylon, that mighty cite: For at one houre is thy iudgment come.
{18:11} And the marchauntes off the earth shall wepe and wayle in them selues, because no man will bye their ware eny more,
{18:12} the ware of golde, and syluer, and of precious stones, off pearle, & sylke, and purple, and skarlet, & all Thynen wod, and all manner vessels of yuery, and all manner vessels of most precious wod, and of brasse, and of yron,
{18:13} & synomom and odours, and oyntmentes, and frankynsence, and wyne, and oyle, and fyne floure, and wheate, and catell, and shepe, and horses, and charrettes, and bodies and soules of men.
{18:14} And the apples that thy soule lusted after, are departed from the. And all thinges which were deyntie, and had in pryce, are departed from the, and thou shalt fynde them no more.
{18:15} The marchauntes of these thinges which were wexed ryche by her, shall stonde afarre of for feare of the punysshment of her, wepynge and waylinge,
{18:16} and sayenge: alas alas, that greate cite, that was clothed in sylke, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with golde, and precious stone, and pearles:
{18:17} for at one houre so greate ryches is come to naught. And euery shippe gouerner, and all they that occupie shippes, and shippmen which worke in the see, stode a farre of,
{18:18} and cryed, when they sawe the smoke of her burnynge, and sayde: what cite is like vnto this greate cite?
{18:19} And they cast dust on their heades, and cryed wepynge, and waylinge, and sayde: Alas, Alas the greate cite, wherin were made ryche all that had shippes in the see, by the reason of her wares: for at one houre is she made desolate.
{18:20} Reioyce ouer her thou heaue, and ye holy Apostles, and prophetes: for God hath geuen youre iudgmet on her.
{18:21} And a mighty angell toke vp a greate stone lyke a mylstone, and cast it in to the see, sayenge: with suche violece shal that greate cite Babylon be cast, and shalbe founde no more.
{18:22} And the voyce of harpers, and musicions, and of pypers, and trompetters, shalbe herde no more in the: and no craftes man (of what soeuer craft he be) shalbe founde eny more in the: and the sounde of a myll shalbe herde no more in the:
{18:23} and the voyce of the brydegrome and of the bryde, shalbe herde no more in the for thy marchauntes were prynces of the earth. And with thyne inchautment were deceaued all nacions:
{18:24} and in her was founde the bloude of the prophetes, and of the sayntes, and of all that were slayne vpo the earth.
{19:1} And after that, I herde the voyce of moch people in heauen, sayenge: Alleluia. Saluacion and glory and honour, and power be ascribed to the LORDE or God,
{19:2} for true and righteous are his iudgmentes, because he hath iudged the greate whore (which did corrupt ye earth with her fornicacion) and hath auenged the bloud of his seruautes of her hond.
{19:3} And agayne they sayde: Alleluia. And smoke rose vp for euermore.
{19:4} And ye xxiiij: elders, & the foure beestes fell downe, and worshipped God that sat on the seate, sayenge: Amen: Alleluia.
{19:5} And a voice came out of the seate, sayenge: prayse or LORDE God all ye that are his seruautes, & ye that feare him both small and greate.
{19:6} And I herde the voyce of moch people, eue as ye voyce of many waters, & as ye voyce of stronge thondrynges, sayenge: Alleluia, for God omnipotent raigneth.
{19:7} Let vs be glad and reioyce, and geue honour to him: for the mariage of the labe is come, and his wife made her selfe ready.
{19:8} And to her was graunted, that she shulde be arayed with pure and goodly sylke. (As for the sylke, it is the rightewesnes of sayntes.)
{19:9} And he sayde vnto me: Blessed are they which are called vnto the Lambes supper. And he sayde vnto me: these are the true sayenges of God.
{19:10} And I fell at his fete, to worshippe him. And he sayde vnto me: Se thou do it not. For I am thy felowe seruaunt, and one of thy brethren, and of them that haue the testimony of Iesus. Worshippe God. For the testimony of Iesus is ye sprete of prophesy.
{19:11} And I sawe heaue open, & beholde, a whyte horsse and he yt sat vpon him, was called faithfull and true, & in rightewesnes dyd iudge and make battayle.
{19:12} His eyes were as a flame of fyre, and on his heade were many crounes: & he had a name wrytten, that noman knewe but him selfe.
{19:13} And he was clothed with a vesture dipt in bloude, and his name is called, ye worde of God.
{19:14} And ye warriers which were in heauen, folowed him vpon whyte horsses, clothed with whyte and pure sylke
{19:15} and out of his mouthe wente a sharppe swerde, that with it he shulde smyte the Heithen: And he shall rule them with a rodde of yron, and he trode the wynefatte of the fearcenesse and wrath of allmightye God.
{19:16} And hath on his vesture and on his thyghe a name wrytten: Kynge of all kinges, and LORDE of all lordes.
{19:17} And I sawe an angell stonde in the Sonne, and he cryed with a lowde voyce, sayenge to all the fowles that flye by the myddes vnder the heauen: Come and gaddre youre selues togedder vnto the supper of the gret God,
{19:18} that ye maye eate the flesshe of kynges, and of hye captaynes, and the flesshe of mighty men, and the flesshe of horsses, and of the that syt on them, and the flesshe of all free men and bond men, both of small and greate.
{19:19} And I sawe the beeste and the kynges of ye earth, and their warriers gadred togedder, to make battayle agaynste him that sat vpon the horsse, and agaynst his sowdiers.
{19:20} And the beeste was taken, and with him that false prophet that wrought myracles before him, with which he disceaued them that receaued the beestes marke, and them that worsshipped his ymage. These both were cast in to a ponde of fyre burnynge wt brymstone:
{19:21} and the remnaunte were slayne with the swearde of him that sat vpon the horsse, which swearde proceded out of his mouth, and all the foules were filled with their flesshe.
{20:1} And I sawe an angell come downe from heauen, hauinge the keye of the bottomlesse pyt, and a gret chayne in his honde.
{20:2} And he toke the dragon that olde serpent (which is the deuell and Satanas) and he bounde him a thousand yeares:
{20:3} and cast him in to the bottomlesse pyt, and he bounde him, and set a seale on him, that he shuld disceaue the people nomoare, tyll the thousand yeares were fulfilled. And after that muste he be lowsed for a littell season.
{20:4} And I sawe seates, and they sat vpon them, and the iudgement was geuen vnto them: and I sawe the soules of them that were beheaded for the witnes of Iesu, and for the worde of God: which had not worshipped the beest, nether his ymage, nether had taken his marke vpon their forheades, or on their hondes: and they lyued, and raygned with Christ a thousand yeare:
{20:5} but the other of the deed men lyued not agayne, vntill the thousand yeare were fynisshed. This is that fyrst resurreccion.
{20:6} Blessed and holy is he that hath parte in the fyrst resurreccion. On soch hath the seconde deeth no power, but they shalbe the prestes of God and of Christ, and shall raygne with him a thousand yeare.
{20:7} And when the thousand yeares are expyred, Sathan shalbe lowsed out of his preson,
{20:8} and shal go out to deceaue the people which are in the foure quarters of the earth. Gog and Magog, to gadder them togedder to batayle, whose nombre is as the sonde off the see:
{20:9} and they went vp on the playne of the earth, and compased the tentes of the sayntes aboute, and the beloued cite. And fyre cam doune from God out of heauen, and deuoured them:
{20:10} and the deuell that disceaued them, was cast in to a lake of fyre and brymstone, where the beest and the false prophet were, and shalbe tormented daye and night for euermore.
{20:11} And I sawe a gret whyte seate, and him that sat on it, from whose face fled awaye both the earth and heauen, and their place was nomore founde.
{20:12} And I sawe the deed, both gret and small stonde before God: And the bokes were opened, and another boke was opened, which is (the boke) of life, and the deed were iudged of tho thinges which were wrytten in the bokes accordinge to their dedes:
{20:13} and the see gaue vp her deed, which were in her, and deeth and hell delyuered vp the deed, which were in them: and they were iudged euery man accordynge to his dedes.
{20:14} And deth and hell were cast in to the lake of fyre. This is that second deeth.
{20:15} And whosoeuer was not founde wrytten in the boke off life, was cast in to the lake of fyre.
{21:1} And I sawe a newe heauen and a newe earth. For the fyrst heauen, and the fyrst earth were vanisshed awaye, and there was nomore See.
{21:2} And I Ihon sawe that holy cite newe Ierusalem come downe from God out of heauen, prepared as a bryde garnisshed for hyr hussband.
{21:3} And I herde a greate voyce from the seate, sayenge: beholde, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he wil dwell with them. And they shalbe his people, and God himselfe shalbe with the, and shalbe their God.
{21:4} And God shal wipe awaye all teares from their eyes. And there shalbe nomore deeth, nether sorowe, nether shal there be eny more payne, for ye olde thinges are gone.
{21:5} And he that sat vpon the seate, sayde: Beholde, I make all thinges newe. And he sayde vnto me: wryte for these wordes are faithfull and true,
{21:6} And he sayde vnto me: it is done I am Alpha and Omega, the begynnynge, and the ende. I wil geue to him that is a thyrst of the well of the water of life fre.
{21:7} He that ouercommeth, shal inheret all thinges I wil be his God, and he shalbe my sonne.
{21:8} But the fearefull and vnbeleuynge, and the abhominable, and murthurers, and whormongers, and sorcerers, and ydolaters, & all lyars, shal haue their parte in the lake, that burneth with fyre and brymstone, which is the seconde death.
{21:9} And there came vnto me one of the seuen angels, which had the seuen vials full of the seuen last plages: and talked with me, sayenge: come hydder, I wil shewe the the bryde, ye labes wyfe.
{21:10} And he caryed me awaye in ye sprete to a greate and an hye moutayne, and he shewed me the greate cite, holy Ierusale descendinge out of heauen from God,
{21:11} hauynge the brightnes of God. And her shynynge was lyke vnto a stone most precious, euen a Iaspar cleare as cristall:
{21:12} & had greate and hye walles, and had twolue gates, and at ye gates twolue angels: and names wrytten, which are the twolue trybes of Israel:
{21:13} on the est parte thre gates, and on the north syde thre gates, and towarde the south thre gates, and from the west thre gates:
{21:14} and the wall of the cite had twolue foundacios, and in them the names of the lambes twolue Apostles.
{21:15} And he that talked with me, had a golden rede to measure the cite with all, and the gates therof, and the wall therof.
{21:16} And the cite was bylt foure square, and the length was as large as the bredth of it, and he measured the cite with the rede twolue M. furlonges: and the length and the bredth, and ye heyth of it, were equall.
{21:17} And he measured the wall therof, an cxliiij. cubittes, after ye measure of a man, which the angel had.
{21:18} And the buyldinge of the wall of it was of Iaspar. And the cite was of pure golde, like vnto cleare glasse:
{21:19} and ye foundacios of the walles and of ye cite were garnysshed with all maner of precious stones. The fyrst foundacion was a Iasper, the seconde a Saphyre, ye thyrde a Calcedony, the fourth a Smaragde:
{21:20} the fyft a Sardonix: the sixt a Sardeos: the seuenth a Crysolite, the eyght berall: the nynth a Topas: the tenth a Crysoprasos: the eleueth a Iacyncte: the twelfte an Amatist.
{21:21} And the twolue gates were twolue pearles, and euery gate was of one pearle, and ye strete of the cite was pure golde, as a thoroweshyninge glasse.
{21:22} And I sawe no temple therin. For the LORDE God allmighty and the lambe is the temple of it,
{21:23} and the cite hath no nede of the Sonne, nether of the mone to lyghten it. For the bryghtnes of God doth light it: and the lambe is the lyght of it.
{21:24} And ye people which are saued, shal walke in the light of it: and the kynges of the earth shal brynge their glory vnto it.
{21:25} And the gates of it shal not be shut by daye. For there shalbe no nyght there.
{21:26} KJV: And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.
{21:27} And there shal entre in to it none vncleane thinge: nether what soeuer worketh abhominacion: or maketh lyes: but they which are wrytten in the lambes boke of life.
{22:1} And he shewed me a pure ryuer of water of life clere as cristall: proceadinge out of the seate of God and of ye lambe
{22:2} in the myddes of the strete of it, and of ether syde of the ryuer was there wod of life: which bare twolue maner of frutes: and gaue frute euery moneth: and the leaues of the wodd serued to heale the people withall.
{22:3} And there shalbe no more cursse, but the seate of God and ye labe shalbe in it: and his seruauntes shal serue him:
{22:4} And shal se his face, and his name shalbe in their for heades.
{22:5} And there shalbe no night there, and they nede no candle, nether light of the Sonne: for the LORDE God geueth the light, and they shal reygne for euermore.
{22:6} And he sayde vnto me: these sayenges are faithfull, and true. And the LORDE God of the holy prophetes sent his angell to shewe vnto his seruantes, the thinges which muste shortly be fulfylled.
{22:7} Beholde, I come shortly. Happy is he yt kepeth ye sayege of ye prophesy of this boke.
{22:8} I am Ihon, which sawe these thinges and herde them. And whe I had herde and sene the, I fell downe to worshippe before the fete of the angell which shewed me these thinges.
{22:9} And he saide vnto me: se thou do it not, for I am thy felowe seruaunt and the felowe seruaut of thy brethren the prophetes, and of them, which kepe the sayenges of this boke. Worshippe God.
{22:10} And he sayde vnto me: seale not the sayenges of the prophesy of this boke. For the tyme is at hode.
{22:11} He that doeth euell, let him do euell styll: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy styll: and he that is righteous, let him be more righteous: and he that is holy, let him be more holy.
{22:12} And beholde, I come shortly, and my rewarde with me, to geue euery ma acordinge as his dedes shalbe.
{22:13} I am Alpha and Omega, ye beginnynge and the ende: the first & the last.
{22:14} Blessed are they that do his commaundementes, that their power maye be in the tree of life, and maye entre in thorow the gates in to the cite.
{22:15} For without are dogges and inchaunters and whormongers, and mortherers, and ydolaters, and whosoeuer loueth or maketh lesinges.
{22:16} I Iesus haue sent myne angell, to testifie vnto you these thinges in the cogregacions. I am the rote and the generacion of Dauid, and the bright mornynge starre.
{22:17} And the sprete and the bryde saye: Come. And let him that heareth, saye also: Come. And let him that is a thyrst, come. And let whosoeuer wyll, take of the water of life fre.
{22:18} I testifye vnto euery man that heareth the wordes of prophesy of this boke yf eny man shal adde vnto these thinges, God shal adde vnto him the plages that are wrytten in this boke.
{22:19} And yf eny man shal mynishe of the wordes of the boke of this prophesy, God shal take awaye his parte out of the boke of life, and out of the holy citie, and fro tho thinges which are wrytten in this boke.
{22:20} He which testifyeth these thinges, sayth: Yee I come quyckly, Amen. Euen so: come LORDE Iesu.
{22:21} The grace of oure LORDE Iesu Christ be with you all. Amen.

{1:1} This is the begynnynge of the gospell of Iesus Christ the sonne of God,
{1:2} as it is wrytte in the prophetes. Beholde, I sende my messauger before thy face, which shal prepare thy waye before the.
{1:3} The voyce of a cryer is in the wyldernes: Prepare the waye of the LORDE, make his pathes straight.
{1:4} Ihon was in the wyldernes, and baptysed, and preached the baptyme of amendment, for the remyssion of synnes.
{1:5} And there wente out vnto him the whole londe of Iewry, and they of Ierusalem, and were all baptysed of him in Iordan, and knowleged their synnes.
{1:6} Ihon was clothed with Camels heer, and with a lethron gerdell aboute his loynes, and ate locustes and wylde hony,
{1:7} and preached, and sayde: There commeth one after me, which is stronger then I: before whom I am not worthy to stoupe downe, and to lowse vp ye lachet of his shue.
{1:8} I baptyse you with water, but he shal baptyse you with the holy goost.
{1:9} And it happened at the same tyme, that Iesus came out of Galile from Nazareth, and was baptysed of Ihon in Iordan.
{1:10} And as soone as he was come out of the water, he sawe that the heauens opened, and the goost as a doue comynge downe vpon him.
{1:11} And there came a voyce from heaue: Thou art my deare sonne, in whom I delyte.
{1:12} And immediatly the sprete droue him in to the wyldernes:
{1:13} and he was in the wyldernes fourtye dayes, and was tempted of Sathan, and was with the wylde beestes. And the angels mynistred vnto him.
{1:14} But after that Ihon was taken, Iesus came in to Galile, and preached the gospell of the kyngdome of God,
{1:15} and sayde: the tyme is fulfylled, and the kyngdome of God is at hande: Amende youre selues, and beleue the gospell.
{1:16} So as he walked by the see of Galile, he sawe Symon and Andrew his brother, castinge their nettes in the see, for they were fysshers.
{1:17} And Iesus sayde vnto the: Folowe me, and I wil make you fysshers of me.
{1:18} And immediatly they left their nettes, and folowed him.
{1:19} And when he was gone a lytle further from thence, he sawe Iames the sonne of Zebede, and Ihon his brother, as they were in the shyppe mendynge their nettes.
{1:20} And anone he called them. And they left their father Zebede in the shyppe with the hyred seruauntes, and folowed him.
{1:21} And they wente in to Capernaum, and immediatly vpon the Sabbathes, he entred in to the synagoge, and taught.
{1:22} And they were astonnyed at his doctryne: for he taught them as one hauynge power, and not as the Scrybes.
{1:23} And in their synagoge there was a man possessed with a foule sprete, which cried
{1:24} and sayde: Oh what haue we to do with the, thou Iesus of Nazareth. Art thou come to destroye us? I knowe that thou art euen yt holy one of God.
{1:25} And Iesus reproued him, and sayde: holde thy tonge, and departe out of him.
{1:26} And the foule sprete tare him, and cried with a loude voyce, and departed out of him.
{1:27} And they were all astonnyed, in so moch that they axed one another amonge the selues, & sayde: What is this? What new lernynge is this? For he comaundeth the foule spretes with power, and they are obedient vnto him.
{1:28} And immediatly the fame of him was noysed rounde aboute in the coastes and borders of Galile.
{1:29} And forth with they wente out of the synagoge, and came in to the house of Symo and Andrew, wt Iames and Ihon.
{1:30} And Symons mother in lawe laye, & had the feuers, and anone they tolde him of her.
{1:31} And he came to her, and set her vp, and toke her by ye hande, and the feuer left her immediatly. And she mynistred vnto them.
{1:32} At euen whan the Sonne was gone downe, they brought vnto him all that were sick and possessed,
{1:33} and the whole cite was gathered together at the dore,
{1:34} and he healed many that were diseased with dyuerse sicknesses, and cast out many deuels, and suffred not the deuels to speake, because they knew him.
{1:35} And in the mornynge before daye, he arose, and wente out. And Iesus departed in to a deserte place, and prayed there.
{1:36} Peter also and they that were with him, folowed after him.
{1:37} And whan they had founde him, they sayde vnto him: Euery man seketh the.
{1:38} And he sayde vnto them: Let us go in to the next townes, that I maye preach there also, for therto am I come.
{1:39} And he preached i their synagoges, in all Galile, and droue out the deuyls.
{1:40} And there came vnto him a leper, which besought him, and kneled before him, & sayde vnto him: Yf thou wilt, thou canst make me cleane.
{1:41} And it pitied Iesus, and he stretched forth his honde, and touched him, and sayde: I wyll, be thou cleane.
{1:42} And wha he had so spoken, immediatly the leprosy departed fro him, and he was clensed.
{1:43} And Iesus forbad him strately, and forth with sent him awaye,
{1:44} and sayde vnto him: Take hede, that thou saye nothinge to eny man, but go thy waye, and shew thy self vnto the prest, and offre for thy clensynge what Moses commaunded, for a wytnesse vnto them.
{1:45} But he whan he was departed, beganne to speake moch of it, and made the dede knowne: in so moch that Iesus coude no more go into the cite openly, but was without in deserte places, & they came vnto him fro all quarters.
{2:1} And after certayne dayes he wente agayne vnto Capernaum, and it was noysed that he was in ye house.
{2:2} And immediatly there was gathered a greate multitude, in so moch that they had no rowme, no not without before the dore. And he spake the worde vnto the.
{2:3} And there came vnto him certaine, which brought one sicke of the palsye borne of foure.
{2:4} And when they coude not come nye him for ye people, they vncouered ye rofe of ye house where he was. And when they had made a hole, they let downe the bed (by coardes) wherin the sicke of ye palsy laye.
{2:5} But when Iesus sawe their faith, he sayde vnto the sicke of the palsye: My sonne, thy synnes are forgeuen the.
{2:6} Neuertheles there were certayne scrybes which sat there, & thought in their hertes:
{2:7} How speaketh this man soch blasphemy? Who can forgeue synnes, but onely God?
{2:8} And immediatly Iesus knew in his sprete, that they thought so in the selues, and saide vnto them: Why thynke ye soch thinges in youre hertes?
{2:9} Whether is easier to saye to the sicke of the palsye: Thy synnes are forgeue the, or to saye: aryse, take vp thy bed and walke.
{2:10} But that ye maye knowe, that ye sonne of man hath power to forgeue synnes vpon earth, he sayde vnto the sicke of ye palsye:
{2:11} I saye vnto the, aryse, take vp thy bed, and go home.
{2:12} And immediatly he arose, toke his bed, and wente forth before them all: in so moch that they were all astonnied, and praysed God, and sayde: We neuer sawe soch.
{2:13} And he wente forth agayne vnto the see, and all the people came vnto him, and he taught them.
{2:14} And as Iesus passed by, he sawe Leui the sonne of Alpheus syttinge at the receate of custome, and sayde vnto him: Folowe me. And he arose, and folowed him.
{2:15} And it came to passe as he sat at the table in his house, there sat many publicans & synners at the table with Iesus and his disciples: For there were many yt folowed him.
{2:16} And whan the scrybes and Pharises sawe that he ate with publicans & synners, they sayde vnto his disciples: Why doth he eate and dryncke with ye publicans and synners?
{2:17} Whan Iesus herde that, he sayde vnto the: The whole nede not ye Phisician, but they that are sycke. I am not come to call the righteous, but the synners to repetaunce.
{2:18} And the disciples of Ihon and of ye Pharises fasted. And there came certaine, which sayde vnto him: Why fast the disciples of Ihon, and of ye Pharises, and thy disciples fast not?
{2:19} And Iesus sayde vnto them: How can the weddinge children fast, whyle the brydegrome is with them? So longe as ye brydegrome is with them, they can not fast.
{2:20} But the tyme wyl come, that the brydegrome shalbe taken from them, and then shal they fast.
{2:21} No man soweth a pece of new cloth vnto an olde garment, for els he taketh awaye the new pece from the olde, and so is the ret worse.
{2:22} And no man putteh new wyne into olde vessels, els the new wyne breaketh the vessels, and the wyne is spylt, and ye vessels perishe: but new wyne must be put in to new vessels.
{2:23} And it chaunsed that vpon ye Sabbath he wente thorow the corne feldes, and his disciples begane to make a waye thorow, and to plucke the eares of ye corne.
{2:24} And the Pharises sayde vnto him: Beholde, what thy disciples do, which is not laufull vpo the Sabbath.
{2:25} And he sayde vnto the: Haue ye neuer red what Dauid dyd, wha he had nede, and was anhongred, both he and they that were wt him:
{2:26} how he wente in to the house of God in the tyme of Abiathar the hye prest, and ate the shewbreds (which was laufull for no man to eate, but for the prestes) and he gaue them vnto him, and to them that were with him?
{2:27} nd he sayde vnto them: The Sabbath was made for mans sake, and not man for the Sabbathes sake.
{2:28} Therfore is the sonne of man LORDE euen ouer the Sabbath.
{3:1} He wente agayne also in to the synagoge, and there was there a ma that had a wythred hande.
{3:2} And they marked him, whether he wolde heale him on the Sabbath, that they might accuse him.
{3:3} And he sayde vnto ye ma with the wythred hade: Steppe forth here.
{3:4} And he sayde vnto the: Is it laufull to do good on the Sabbath? Or is it laufull to do euell? to saue life, or to kyll? But they helde their tonge.
{3:5} And he loked rounde aboute vpon them with wrath, and was sory for the harde hertes of the, and sayde vnto the man: Stretch out thine hande. And he stretched it out. And his hande was made whole like as ye other.
{3:6} And the Pharises wete out, and straight waye they helde a councell with Herodes officers agaynst him, how they might destroye him.
{3:7} But Iesus departed awaye with his disciples vnto the see. And there folowed him moch people out of Galile, and fro Iewry,
{3:8} and from Ierusale, and out of Idumea, and from beyonde Iordan, and they that dwelt aboute Tyre and Sydon, a greate multitude which had herde of his noble actes, and came vnto him.
{3:9} And he spake vnto his disciples yt they shulde kepe a shyppe for him because of the people, lest they shulde thrunge him:
{3:10} for he healed many of them, in so moch, that all they which were plaged,preased vpon him, that they might touch him.
{3:11} And whan the foule spretes sawe him, they fell downe before him, and cried, and sayde: Thou art the sonne of God.
{3:12} And he charged them strately, that they shulde not make him knowne.
{3:13} And he wente vp in to a mountayne, and called vnto him whom he wolde, and they came vnto him.
{3:14} And he ordeyned ye twolue, that they shulde be with him, and that he might sende them out to preach,
{3:15} and that they might haue power to heale sicknesses, and to cast out deuyls.
{3:16} And vnto Symon he gaue the name Peter,
{3:17} and Iames the sonne of Zebede, and Ihon the brother of Iames, and gaue the the name Bonarges, that is to saye, the children of thonder:
{3:18} and Andrew, and Philippe, and Bartylmew, and Mathew, and Thomas, and Iames ye sonne of Alpheus, and Taddeus, and Symon of Cana,
{3:19} and Iudas Iscarioth which betrayed him.And they came to house.
{3:20} Then assembled the people together agayne, in so moch that they had no leysure to eate.
{3:21} And when they that were aboute him herde of it, they wente out to holde him. For they sayde: he taketh to moch vpon him.
{3:22} But the scrybes that were come downe from Ierusalem, sayde: He hath Belzebub, and thorow the chefe deuell casteth he out deuyls.
{3:23} And he called them together, and spake vnto them in symilitudes:How can one Sathan dryue out another?
{3:24} And yf a realme be deuyded in it self, how can it endure?
{3:25} And yf a house be deuyded agaynst it self, it can not contynue.
{3:26} Yf Sathan now ryse agaynst him self, and be at variaunce with him self, he can not endure, but is at an ende.
{3:27} No man can entre in to a stronge mans house, and take awaye his goodes, excepte he first bynde the stronge man, and then spoyle his house.
{3:28} Verely I saye vnto you: All synnes shalbe forgeuen the children of men, and the blasphemy also wherwith they blaspheme.
{3:29} But who so blasphemeth the holy goost, hath neuer forgeuenes, but is giltie of the euerlastinge iudgment.
{3:30} For they sayde: he hath an vncleane sprete.
{3:31} And there came his mother and his brethre, and stode without, and sente vnto him, and called him.
{3:32} And the people sat aboute him, and sayde vnto him: Beholde, thy mother and thy brethre axe after the without.
{3:33} And he answered, and sayde: Who is my mother and my brethren?
{3:34} And he loked rounde aboute him vpon his disciples, which sat rounde in compasse aboute him, and sayde: Beholde, my mother and my brethren.
{3:35} For who so euer doth the will of God the same is my brother, and my sister and my mother.
{4:1} And he begane agayne to teach by ye seeside. And there gathered moch people vnto him, so that he wente in to a shippe, and sat vpon the water. And all the people stode vpon the londe by the see syde.
{4:2} And he preached longe vnto the by parables, and sayde vnto the in his doctryne:
{4:3} Herken to, beholde, there wente out a sower to sowe:
{4:4} & it happened whyle he was sowinge, that some fell by the waye syde. Then came the foules vnder the heauen, and ate it vp.
{4:5} Some fell vpon stonye grounde, where it had not moch earth: and anone it came vp, because it had not depe earth.
{4:6} Now wha the Sonne arose, it caught heate: and in so moch as it had no rote, it wythred awaye.
{4:7} And some fel amonge the thornes, & the thornes grew vp, and choked it, and it gaue no frute.
{4:8} And some fell vpon a good grounde, which gaue frute, that came vp and grew. And some bare thirtie folde, and some sixtie folde, and some an hundreth folde,
{4:9} And he sayde vnto them: Who so hath eares to heare, let him heare.
{4:10} And whan he was alone, they that were aboute him wt the twolue, axed him concernynge this parable.
{4:11} And he sayde vnto the: Vnto you it is geuen, to knowe the mystery of the kyngdome of God: but vnto them that are without, all thinges happen by parables,
{4:12} that with seynge eyes they maye se, and not discerne: and that with hearinge eares they maye heare, and not vnderstode, lest at eny tyme they turne, and their synnes be forgeuen them.
{4:13} And he sayde vnto them: Vnderstonde ye not this parable? How wyl ye then vnderstonde all other parables?
{4:14} The sower soweth the worde.
{4:15} These be they that are by the waye syde: where the worde is sowne, and as soone as they haue herde it, immediatly commeth Satha, and taketh awaye the worde that was sowen in their hertes.
{4:16} And likewyse are they that are sowen on the stonye grounde: which when they haue herde the worde, receaue it with ioye,
{4:17} and haue no rote in them: but endure for a tyme. When trouble and persecucion aryseth for ye wordes sake, immediatly they are offended.
{4:18} And these are they that are sowen amoge the thornes: which heare the worde,
{4:19} and ye carefulues of this worlde, and the disceatfulnes of riches, and many other lustes entre in, and choke the worde, and so is it made vnfrutefull.
{4:20} And these are they yt are sowen vpo a good grounde: Which heare ye worde, and receaue it, and brynge forth frute: some thirtie folde, and some sixtie folde, and some an hundreth folde.
{4:21} And he sayde vnto the: Is a candle lighted to be put vnder a busshell, or vnder a table? Is it not lighted, to be set vpon a candelsticke?
{4:22} For there is nothinge hyd, that shal not be openly shewed: and there is nothinge secrete, yt shal not be knowne.
{4:23} Who so hath eares to heare, let him heare.
{4:24} And he sayde vnto them: Take hede what ye heare. With what measure ye mete, with the same shal it be measured vnto you agayne. And vnto you that heare this, shal more be geuen.
{4:25} For who so hath, vnto him shal be geuen: and who so hath not, from him shalbe taken awaye, euen that he hath.
{4:26} And he sayde: The kyngdome of God is after this maner, as when a man casteth sede vpon the londe,
{4:27} and slepeth, and stondeth vp night and daye, and the sede spryngeth vp, & groweth, he not knowinge of it.
{4:28} (For the earth bryngeth forth frute of her selfe: first the grasse, afterwarde the eare, then the full wheate in the eare)
{4:29} But whan she hath brought forth the frute, he putteth to the syckell, because the haruest is come.
{4:30} And he sayde: Where vnto wyl we licken the kyngdome of God? Or by what symilitude wyl we compare it?
{4:31} It is like a grayne of mustarde sede, which wha it is sowe vpo the londe, is the leest amonge all sedes of the earth.
{4:32} And wha it is sowen, it groweth vp, and is greater then all herbes, and getteth greate braunches, so yt the foules vnder the heaue maye dwell vnder ye shadowe therof.
{4:33} And by many soch parables he spake the worde vnto the, there after as they might heare it,
{4:34} & without parables spake he nothinge vnto them: but vnto his disciples he expounded all thinges pryuately.
{4:35} And the same daye at euen he sayde vnto them: let us passe ouer.
{4:36} And they let the people go, and toke him as he was in the shippe, and there were mo shippes with him.
{4:37} And there arose a greate storme of wynde, and dasshed the wawes in to the shippe, so that the shippe was full.
{4:38} And he was behynde in the shippe and slepte vpon a pelowe. And they awoke him & sayde vnto him: Master, Carest thou not, that we perishe?
{4:39} And he arose, and rebuked ye wynde, and sayde vnto the see: Peace, and be styll, And the wynde was layed, & there folowed a greate calme.
{4:40} And he sayde vnto them: Why are ye so fearfull? How is it, that ye haue no faith?
{4:41} And they feared exceadingly, & sayde one to another: What is he this? For wynde and see are obedient vnto him.
{5:1} And they came ouer vnto the other syde of the see in to the countre of the Gaderenites.
{5:2} And whan he wete out of the shippe, there met him a ma possessed of an vncleane sprete,
{5:3} which had his dwellinge in the graues. And no man coude bynde hym, no not with cheynes:
{5:4} for he was oft bounde with fetters & cheynes, and pluckte the cheynes in sunder, and brake the fetters in peces, and no man coude tame him.
{5:5} And he was allwaye both daye and night vpon the mountaynes and in the graues crienge, and beatinge him self with stones.
{5:6} But whan he sawe Iesus afarre of, he ranne, and fell downe before him,
{5:7} and cried loude, and sayde: What haue I to do with the O Iesus thou sonne of ye Hyest God? I charge the by God, that thou torment me not.
{5:8} Neuertheles he sayde vnto him: Go out of the man thou foule sprete.
{5:9} And he axed him: What is thy name? And he answered and sayde: My name is Legion, for there be many of vs.
{5:10} And he prayed him instantly, that he wolde not sende them awaye out of that countre.
{5:11} And euen there in the mountaynes there was a greate heerd of swyne fedynge,
{5:12} and all the deuyls praied him, and sayde: Let vs departe in to the swyne.
{5:13} And anone Iesus gaue them leue. Then the foule spretes wente out, and intred in to the swyne. And the heerd of swyne, ranne heedlinges in to ye see with a storme. They were aboute a two thousande swyne, and were drowned in the see.
{5:14} And the swyneherdes fled, and tolde it in the cite, and in the countre. And they wente out for to se what had happened,
{5:15} and came to Iesus, and sawe hym which was possessed and had had ye legion, that he sat, and was clothed, and in his right mynde, and they were afrayed.
{5:16} And they that had sene it, tolde them what had happened to the possessed, and of the swyne.
{5:17} And they beganne to praye him, that he wolde departe out of their coastes.
{5:18} And whan he came in to the shyppe, the possessed prayed him, that he might be with him.
{5:19} Neuertheles Iesus wolde not suffre hi, but saide vnto hi: Go i to yi house & to thine awne, and tell the how greate benefites the LORDE hath done for ye, and how he hath had mercy vpon the.
{5:20} And he wente his waye, and beganne to publish in the ten cities how greate benefites Iesus had done for him. And euery man marueyled.
{5:21} And whan Iesus passed ouer agayne by shippe, there gathered moch people vnto him, and was by the see syde.
{5:22} And beholde, there came one of the rulers of the synagoge, whose name was Iairus. And whan he sawe him, he fell downe at his fete,
{5:23} and besought him greatly, & sayde: My doughter is at the poynte (of death) let it be thy pleasure to come and laye thine honde vpon her, that she maye be whole and lyue.
{5:24} And he wente with him, and moch people folowed him, and thronged him.
{5:25} And there was a woman, which had had the bloude yssue twolue yeares,
{5:26} and had suffred moch of many phisicians, and spent all that she had, and was not helped, but rather in worse case.
{5:27} Whan she herde of Iesus, she came behynde amonge the people, and touched his garment.
{5:28} For she sayde: Yf I maye but touch his clothes, I shalbe whole.
{5:29} And immediatly ye fountayne of hir bloude was dryed vp, and she felt in hir body, yt she was healed of the plage.
{5:30} And forth with Iesus felt in himself the power that was gone out of him, and turned him aboute amoge the people, and sayde: Who hath touched my clothes?
{5:31} And his disciples sayde vnto him: Thou seist that the people thrusteth the, and sayest: Who hath touched me?
{5:32} And he loked aboute to se her, that had done it.
{5:33} As for the woman, she feared and trembled (for she knew, what was done in her) and came and fell downe before him, and tolde him the whole trueth.
{5:34} And he sayde vnto her: Doughter, thy faith hath made the whole: go thy waye in peace, & be whole of thy plage.
{5:35} Whyle he yet spake, there came certayne from the ruler of the synagoges house, and sayde: Thy doughter is deed, why troublest thou the master eny more?
{5:36} But Iesus herde right soone the worde that was spoken, and sayde vnto the ruler of the synagoge: Be not thou afrayed, beleue onely.
{5:37} And he suffred no ma to folowe him, but Peter and Iames and Ihon his brother.
{5:38} And he came in to the ruler of the synagoges house, and sawe the busynes, and them that wepte and wayled greatly:
{5:39} and he wente in, and sayde vnto them: Why make ye this a doo, and wepe? The mayde is not deed, but slepeth.
{5:40} And they laughed him to scorne And he droue them all out, and toke the father and mother of the mayde, and them that were with him, and wente in where the mayden laye.
{5:41} And he toke the mayde by the honde, and sayde vnto her: Thabitha Cumi (which is by interpretaeion) Mayde, I saye vnto the: Aryse.
{5:42} And immediatly the mayden arose, and walked. She was twolue yeare olde, and they were astonnyed out of measure.
{5:43} And he charged them strately, that no man shulde knowe of it, and sayde vnto them, that they shulde geue her to eate.
{6:1} And he departed thence, and came in to his awne countre, and his disciples folowed him.
{6:2} And wha ye Sabbath came, he begane to teach in their synagoge. And many that herde it, marueled at his lernynge, and sayde: From whece hath he these thinges? And what wyssdome is this, yt is geue him: & soch actes as are done by his handes?
{6:3} Is not this the Carpenter the sonne of Mary, and the brother of Iames and Ioses, and of Iude and Symon? Are not his sisters here with vs also? And they were offended at him.
{6:4} But Iesus saide vnto the: A prophet is nowhere lesse set by, the in his awne countre, & at home amonge his awne.
{6:5} And he coude not shew one miracle there, but layed his handes vpon a few sicke, and healed them.
{6:6} And he marueyled at their vnbeleue.And he wente aboute in the townes on euery syde, and taught them.
{6:7} And called the twolue, and begane to sende them two and two, and gaue them power ouer the vncleane spretes.
{6:8} And commaunded the, that they shulde take nothinge with them towarde their iourney, saue onely a rodde: no scrippe, no bred, no money in the gerdell,
{6:9} but shulde be shod with sandales, and that they shulde not put on two cotes.
{6:10} And he sayde vnto them: Where so euer ye shal entre in to an house, there abyde, tyll ye go thence.
{6:11} And who so euer wyll not receaue you, ner heare you, departe out from thence, and shake of the dust from youre fete, for a wytnesse vnto them. I saye vnto you verely: It shal be easyer for Sodome and Gomorra in the daye of iudgment, then for that cite.
{6:12} And they wete forth, and preached, that men shulde amede them selues,
{6:13} and they cast out many deuyls: and many that were sicke anoynted they with oyle, and healed the.
{6:14} And it came to kynge Herods eares (for his name was now knowne) and he sayde: Ihon the baptist is rysen agayne from the deed, and therfore are his dedes so mightie.
{6:15} But some sayde: It is Elias. Some sayde: It is a prophet, or one of ye prophetes.
{6:16} But when Herode herde it, he sayde: It is Ihon whom I beheeded, he is rysen againe from the deed.
{6:17} This Herode had sent forth, and taken Ihon, and put him in preson, because of Herodias his brother Philippes wife, for he had maried her.
{6:18} Neuertheles Ihon sayde vnto Herode It is not laufull for the to haue yi brothers wife.
{6:19} But Herodias layed wayte for him, and wolde haue slayne him, and coude not.
{6:20} Notwithstodinge Herode feared Iho, for he knew that he was a iust and holy man: and he kepte him, and herkened vnto him in many thinges, and herde him gladly.
{6:21} And there came a conuenient daye, that Herode on his byrth daye made a supper to the lordes, captaynes and chefe estates of Galile.
{6:22} Then the daughter of Herodias came in, and daunsed, and pleased Herode, and them that sat at the table. Then sayde the kynge vnto ye damsel: Axe of me what thou wilt, I wil geue it the.
{6:23} And he sware vnto her: What soeuer thou shalt axe of me, I wil geue it the, euen vnto ye one half of my kyngdome.
{6:24} She wente forth, and sayde vnto hir mother: what shal I axe? She sayde: Ihon baptistes heade.
{6:25} And immediatly she wete in to the kinge with haist, and sayde: I will that thou geue me straight waye in a platter the heed of Ihon the baptist.
{6:26} Then the kynge was sory: Yet for the oothes sake and the that sat at the table, he wolde not saye her nay.
{6:27} And immediatly he sent the hangman, and commaunded his heade to be brought in. So he wete, and heeded him in the preson,
{6:28} and brought his heade in a platter, and gaue it vnto the damsell, and the damsell gaue it vnto hir mother.
{6:29} And whan his disciples herde that, they came and toke his body, & layed it in a graue.
{6:30} And the Apostles came together vnto Iesus, and tolde hi all, and what they had done and taught.
{6:31} And he sayde vnto them: Let vs go out of the waye in to the wyldernes, and rest a litle. For there were many comers and goers, and they had not tyme ynough to eate.
{6:32} And there he passed by shippe out of ye waye in to a deserte place.
{6:33} And the people sawe the departynge awaye, and many knewe of it, & ranne thither together of fote out of all cities, & came before the, & came vnto him.
{6:34} And Iesus wente out, and sawe moch people, and had copassion vpon them: for they were as the shepe, that haue no shepherde, and he begane a loge sermon.
{6:35} Now whan the daye was farre past, his disciples came vnto him, and sayde: This is a deserte place,
{6:36} let them departe, that they maye go in to the vyllagies and townes rounde aboute, and bye them selues bred, for they haue nothinge to eate.
{6:37} But Iesus answered and sayde vnto them: geue ye them to eate.And they sayde vnto him: Shal we go then, and bye two hundreth peny worth of bred, and geue them to eate?
{6:38} He sayde vnto them: How many loaues haue ye? Go and se. And when they had searched, they sayde: Fyue, and two fisshes.
{6:39} And he commaunded them all to syt downe by table fulles vpon the grene grasse.
{6:40} And they sat downe here a rowe and there a rowe by hundreds and by fifties.
{6:41} And he toke the fyue loaues and two fisshes, and loked vp vnto heauen, and gaue thankes, and brake the loaues, and gaue to the disciples, to set before them. And the two fisshes parted he amonge them all.
{6:42} And they all ate, and were satisfied.
{6:43} And they toke vp twolue baskettes full of ye broken peces and of the fisshes.
{6:44} And they that ate, were aboute fyue thousande men.
{6:45} And anone he caused his disciples to go in to the shippe, and to passe ouer before him vnto Bethsaida, whyle he sent awaye the people.
{6:46} KJV: And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.
{6:47} And at euen was the shippe in the myddest of the see, and he alone vpon the londe.
{6:48} And he sawe that they were in parell with rowynge, for the wynde was agaynst them.And aboute the fourth watch of ye night he came vnto them, and walked vpon the see, and wolde haue gone ouer by the.
{6:49} And whan they sawe him walkinge vpon the see, they thought it had bene a sprete, and cried out,
{6:50} for they sawe him all, and were afrayed. But immediatly he talked with them, and sayde vnto them: Be of good comforte, it is I, be not afrayed.
{6:51} And he wete vnto them in to the shippe, and the wynde ceassed. And they were astonnyed, and marueled exceadingly:
{6:52} for they had forgotten the loaues, and their hert was blynded.
{6:53} And whan they were passed ouer, they came in to lande of Genezareth, and drue vp in to the hauen.
{6:54} And whan thy were come out of the shippe, immediatly they knewe him,
{6:55} and ranne thorow out all the region aboute, and beganne on euery syde to brynge vnto him in beddes soch as were sicke, where they herde that he was.
{6:56} And whither so euer he entred in to townes, cities or vyllagies, there layed they the sicke in the market place, and prayed him, that they might but touch the hemme of his garment. And as many as touched him, were made whole.
{7:1} And there came vnto him the Pharises, and certayne of the scrybes, that were come from Ierusale.
{7:2} And wha they sawe certayne of his disciples eate bred with comon (that is, with vnwashen) handes, they complayned.
{7:3} For the Pharises & all the Iewes eate not, excepte they wash their handes oft tymes: obseruynge so the tradicions of the elders.
{7:4} And whan they come from the market, they eate not, excepte they wasshe. And many other thynges there be, which they haue taken vpon them to obserue, as the washinge of cuppes and cruses, and brasen vessels and tables.
{7:5} Then the Pharises and scrybes axed him: Why walke not thy disciples after the tradicions of the elders, but eate bred with vnwasshen handes?
{7:6} But he answered & sayde vnto them: Full well hath Esay prophecied of you Ypocrytes, as it is wrytte: This people honoureth me wt their lippes, but their hert is farre fro me.
{7:7} But in vayne do they serue me, whyle they teach soch doctrynes as are nothinge but the commaundemetes of me.
{7:8} Ye leaue the comaundement of God and kepe the tradicions of men, as the wasshynge of cruses and cuppes, & many soch thinges do ye.
{7:9} And he saide vnto the: How goodly haue ye cast asyde the comaundement of God, to manteyne youre owne tradicions?
{7:10} For Moses sayde: Honoure father & mother. Whoso curseth father and mother, shal dye the death.
{7:11} But ye saye: A ma shal saye to father or mother: Corban, that is, The thinge yt I shulde helpe the withall, is geue vnto God.
{7:12} And thus ye suffre him nomore to do ought for his father or his mother,
{7:13} & make Gods worde of none effecte, thorow youre owne tradicions that ye haue set vp. And many soch thinges do ye.
{7:14} And he called vnto him all the people, and sayde vnto them: Herken vnto me ye all, and vnderstonde me.
{7:15} There is nothinge without a man, that can defyle him, whan it entreth in to him. But that goeth out of him, that is it that maketh the man vncleane.
{7:16} Yf eny man haue eares to heare, let him heare.
{7:17} And whan he came from the people in to ye house, his disciples axed him of this symilitude.
{7:18} And he sayde vnto them: Are ye so then without vnderstondinge? Perceaue ye not yet, yt euery thinge which is without, and goeth in to the ma, can not defyle him?
{7:19} For it entreth not in to his hert, but in to ye bely, and goeth out in to the draught, that purgeth all meates.
{7:20} And he sayde: The thinge that goeth out of the man,
{7:21} that defyleth the man. For from within out of the hert of man proceade euell thoughtes, aduoutrye, whordome, murthur,
{7:22} theft, coueteousnes, wickednes, disceate, vnclennes, a wicked eye, blasphemy, pryde, foolishnes.
{7:23} All these euell thinges go from within, and defyle the man.
{7:24} And he arose, and wente from thence in to the borders of Tyre and Sydon, & entred in to an house, and wolde let no man knowe of it, and yet coude he not be hyd:
{7:25} For a certayne woman (whose doughter had a foule sprete) herde of him, and came and fell downe at his fete
{7:26} (and it was in Heithe woman of Syrophenices) and she besought him, that he wolde dryue out the deuell from hir doughter.
{7:27} But Iesus sayde vnto her: Let the children be fed first: It is not mete to take the childres bred, and to cast it vnto dogges.
{7:28} She answered and sayde vnto him: Yee LORDE, neuertheles the whelpes also eate vnder ye table, of ye childres cromes.
{7:29} And he sayde vnto her: Because of this sayenge go thy waye, the deuell is departed out of thy doughter.
{7:30} And she wente vnto her house, & founde that the deuell was departed, and hir doughter lyenge on the bed.
{7:31} And whan he wente out agayne from the coastes of Tyre and Sydon, he came vnto the see of Galile, thorw the myddes of ye coastes of the te cities.
{7:32} And they brought vnto him one that was deaf, and had impediment in his speach. And they prayed him, that he wolde laye his hande vpon him.
{7:33} And he toke him a syde from the people, and put his fyngers in his eares, and dyd spyt, and touched his tonge,
{7:34} and loked vp vnto heauen, sighed, and sayde vnto him: Ephatha, that is, be opened.
{7:35} And immediatly his eares were opened, and the bonde of his toge was lowsed, and he spake right.
{7:36} And he charged them, that they shulde tell noman.But the more he forbad them, the more they published it,
{7:37} & marueyled out of measure, and sayde: He hath done all thinges well. The deaf hath he made to heare, and the domme to speake.
{8:1} At the same tyme whan there was moch people there, and had nothinge to eate, Iesus called his disciples to him, and sayde vnto them:
{8:2} I haue compassion vpon the people, for they haue taried wt me now thre dayes, & haue nothinge to eate.
{8:3} And yf I let them go home fro me fastynge, they shulde faynte by the waye. For some of them were come from farre.
{8:4} And his disciples answered him: Where shulde we get bred here in the wyldernes, to satisfie them?
{8:5} And he axed the: How many loaues haue ye? They sayde: Seuen.
{8:6} And he commaunded the people to syt downe vpon the grounde. And he toke the seuen loaues, and gaue thakes, and brake them, and gaue the vnto his disciples to set them before the people. And they set the before the people.
{8:7} And they had a few small fyshes, and whan he had geuen thankes, he bad set the same before the people.
{8:8} They ate, and were satisfied, & toke vp seue basskettes full of ye broke meate that was left.
{8:9} And they yt ate, were vpo a foure thousande. And he sent the awaye.
{8:10} And forth with he wente in to a shippe with his disciples, and came in to the coastes of Dalmanutha.
{8:11} And the Pharises wente out, and begane to dispute with him, and tempted him, and desyred a token of him from heaue.
{8:12} And he sighed in his sprete, and sayde: Why doth this generacion seke a token? Verely I saye vnto you: There shal no toke be geue vnto this generacion.
{8:13} And he left them, and wete againe into the shippe, and passed ouer.
{8:14} And they forgat to take bred with them, and had nomore with them in the shippe but one loaf.
{8:15} And he comaunded them, and sayde: Take hede, and bewarre of the leuen of the Pharises, and of the leuen of Herode.
{8:16} And their myndes wauered here and there, and sayde amonge them selues: This is it, that we haue no bred.
{8:17} And Iesus vnderstode that, and sayde vnto them: Why trouble ye youre selues, that ye haue no bred? Are ye yet without vnderstondinge? Haue ye yet a blynded hert in you?
{8:18} Haue ye eyes, & se not? and haue ye eares, and heare not? and remebre ye not,
{8:19} that I brake fyue loaues amonge fyue thousande, how many basskettes full of broken meate toke ye then vp? They sayde: twolue.
{8:20} And whan I brake the seuen amonge the foure thousande, how many baskettes full of broken meate toke ye then vp? They sayde: Seuen.
{8:21} And he sayde vnto the: Why are ye then without vnderstondinge?
{8:22} And he came to Bethsaida, & they brought one blynde vnto him, and prayed him to touch him.
{8:23} And he toke the blynde by the hande, aud led him out of the towne, and spat in his eyes, and layed his handes vpon him, and axed him whether he sawe ought.
{8:24} And he loked vp, and sayde: I se men goynge as yf I sawe trees.
{8:25} After this he layed his handes vpon his eyes ageyne, and made him to se. And he was brought to right againe, and sawe all clearly.
{8:26} And he sent him home, and sayde: Go not in to ye towne, and tell it also vnto noman therin.
{8:27} And Iesus wente out and his disciples into the townes of the cite Cesarea Philippi, And in ye waye he axed his disciples and sayde vnto them: What do men saye, that I am?
{8:28} They answered: They saye, thou art Ihon the baptist: Some saye thou art Elias, some that thou art one of the prophetes.
{8:29} And he sayde vnto them: But whom saye ye that I am? Then answered Peter and sayde vnto him: Thou art very Christ.
{8:30} And he charged them strately, that they shulde tell no man of him.
{8:31} And he begane to teach them: The sonne of man must suffre many thinges, and be cast out of the elders & hye prestes and scrybes, and be put to death, and after thre dayes ryse agayne.
{8:32} And that worde spake he fre openly. And Peter toke him vnto him, and beganne to rebuke him.
{8:33} But he turned him aboute, and loked vpon his disciples, and reproued Peter, and sayde: Go after me thou Sathan, for thou sauourest not the thinges that be of God, but of men.
{8:34} And he called vnto him the people with his disciples, and sayde vnto them: Who so euer wyl folowe me, let him denye himself, and take vp his crosse, and folowe me.
{8:35} For who so euer wyl saue his life, shal lose it: and who so euer loseth his life for my sake and ye gospels, ye same shal saue it.
{8:36} What helpeth it a ma though he wane the whole worlde, and yet toke harme in his soule?
{8:37} Or, what can a man geue, to redeme his soule withall?
{8:38} Who so euer is ashamed of me and of my wordes amonge this aduouterous and synfull generacion, of him shal the sonne of man also be ashamed, whan he commeth in the glory of his father with the holy angels.
{9:1} And he sayde vnto them: Verely I saye vnto you: There stode here some, which shal not taist of death, tyll they se the kyngdome of God come with power.
{9:2} And after sixe dayes Iesus toke vnto him Peter, Iames and Ihon, and brought them vp in to an hye mountayne out of the waye alone, and was ttasfigured before them,
{9:3} and his clothes were bright and very whyte as ye snowe, so whyte as no fuller can make vpon earth.
{9:4} And there appeared vnto the Elias with Moses, and they talked with Iesus.
{9:5} And Peter answered, and sayde vnto Iesus: Rabbi, here is good beynge for vs. Let vs make thre tabernacles: one for the, one for Moses, and one for Elias.
{9:6} For he knewe not what he sayde, and they were very fearfull.
{9:7} And there was a cloude, which ouershadowed the. And out of the cloude there came a voyce, and sayde: This is my deare sonne, heare him.
{9:8} And immediatly they loked aboute them, and sawe noman more then Iesus onely with them.
{9:9} But whan they wente downe from the mountayne, Iesus charged them, that they shulde tell no man what they had sene, tyll the sonne of man were rysen agayne from the deed.
{9:10} And they kepte that sayenge by them, and axed one another: What is that rysinge agayne from the deed?
{9:11} And they axed him, and sayde: Why saye the scrybes then, that Elias must first come?
{9:12} He answered and sayde vnto them: Elias shal come first in dede, and brynge all thinges to right agayne. The sonne of man also shal suffre many thinges, and be despysed, as it is wrytten.
{9:13} But I saye vnto you: Elias is come, and they haue done vnto him what they wolde, acordinge as it is wrytten of him?
{9:14} And he came to his disciples, and sawe moch people aboute them, and the scrybes disputynge with them.
{9:15} And as soone as the people sawe, they were astonnyed, and ranne vnto him, and saluted him.
{9:16} And he axed the scrybes: What dispute ye with them?
{9:17} And one of the people answered, and sayde: Master, I haue brought vnto the my sonne, which hath a domme sprete:
{9:18} and whan so euer he taketh him, he teareth him, and he fometh, and gnassheth with the teth, and pyneth awaye, & I haue spoken to thy disciples that they shulde cast him out, and they coude not.
{9:19} He answered him, and sayde: O thou vnfaithfull generacion, how longe shal I be with you? How longe shal I suffre you? Brynge hi hither to me.
{9:20} And they brought him vnto him. And as soone as the sprete sawe him, he tare him, and fell vpon the earth, and weltred and fomed.
{9:21} And he axed his father: How longe is it, sens this happened vnto him? He sayde: Of a childe,
{9:22} and oft tymes hath he cast him in to the fyre and water, to destroye him: but yf thou canst do enythinge, haue mercy vpon vs, and helpe vs.
{9:23} Iesus sayde vnto him: Yf thou couldest beleue: All thinges are possible vnto him that beleueth.
{9:24} And immediatly the father of the childe cried with teares, and sayde: LORDE I beleue: O helpe thou myne vnbeleue.
{9:25} Now whan Iesus sawe that the people ranne to, he rebuked the foule sprete, and sayde vnto him: Thou domme and deaf sprete, I charge the, departe out of him, and entre nomore in to him from hence forth.
{9:26} And he cried, and rent him sore, and departed. And he was as though he had bene deed, in so moch that many sayde: he is deed.
{9:27} But Iesus toke him by the hande, and set him vp. And he arose.
{9:28} And whan he came home, his disciples axed him secretly: Why coulde not we cast him out?
{9:29} And he sayde: This kynde ca go out by no meanes, but by prayer and fastynge.
{9:30} And they departed thece, and toke their iourney thorow Galile, and he wolde not that eny man shulde knowe of it.
{9:31} But he taught his disciples, and sayde vnto them: The sonne of ma shalbe delyuered in to the handes of men, and they shal put him to death: and whan he is put to death, he shal ryse ageyne the thirde daye.
{9:32} But they vnderstode not that worde, and were afrayed to axe him.
{9:33} And he came to Capernaum. And whan he was at home, he axed them? What disputed ye amonge youre selues by ye waye?
{9:34} But they helde their tuges: For they had disputed by the waye amonge them selues, who shulde be ye greatest.
{9:35} And he sat downe, and called the twolue, and sayde vnto them: Yf eny man wyl be the first, the same shal be the last of all, and the seruaunt of all.
{9:36} And he toke a childe, and set him in the myddest of them, and toke him in his armes, and sayde vnto them:
{9:37} Who so euer receaueth soch a childe in my name, receaueth me: and who so euer receaueth me, receaueth not me, but him that hath sent me.
{9:38} Ihon answered him, and sayde: Master, we sawe one dryue out deuels in thy name, but he foloweth not vs, and we forbad him because he foloweth vs not.
{9:39} But Iesus sayde: Forbyd him not: for there is no ma that doth a myracle in my name, and can soone speake euell of me.
{9:40} For who so euer is not agaynst vs, the same is for vs.
{9:41} And who so euer geueth you a cuppe of water to drynke in my name, because ye belonge vnto Christ, verely I saye vnto you: he shal not lose his rewarde.
{9:42} And who so offendeth one of these litle ones that beleue in me, it were better for him, that a mylstone were haged aboute his neck, and he cast in to the see.
{9:43} Yf thy hade offende the, cut him of. Better it is for the to entre in to life lame, the hauynge two hondes to go in to hell in to the euerlastinge fyre,
{9:44} where their worme dyeth not, and their fyre goeth not out.
{9:45} Yf thy fote offende the, cut him of. Better it is for the to entre into life crepell, the hauynge two fete to be cast in to hell in the fyre euerlastynge,
{9:46} where their worme dyeth not, and their fyre goeth not out.
{9:47} Yf thine eye offende the, cast him from the. Better it is for the to entre in to ye kyngdome of God with one eye, then hauynge two eyes to be cast in to the fyre of hell:
{9:48} where their worme dyeth not, and their fyre goeth not out.
{9:49} For euery ma must be salted wt fyre, & euery offerynge shalbe seasoned wt salt.
{9:50} The salt is good: but yf ye salt be vnsauery, wherwith all shal it be salted? Haue salt in you & peace amonge yor selues one with another.
{10:1} And he rose vp, and came from thence in to the places of Iewry beyonde Iordan. And the people wete agayne vnto him by heapes, and as his maner was he taught them agayne.
{10:2} And the Pharises came vnto him, and axed him, yf it were laufull for a man to put awaye his wife, and tempted him withall.
{10:3} But he answered and sayde: What hath Moses comaunded you?
{10:4} They sayde: Moses suffred to wryte a testimoniall of deuorcemet, and to put her awaye.
{10:5} Iesus answered, and sayde vnto them: Because of ye hardnesse of yor hert dyd Moses wryte you this commaundement.
{10:6} But from the first creacion God made the man and woman.
{10:7} For this cause shal a man leaue his father & mother, and cleue vnto his wife,
{10:8} and they two shalbe one flesh. Now are they not twayne the, but one flesh.
{10:9} Let not man therfore put asunder that, which God hath coupled together.
{10:10} And at home his disciples axed him agayne of ye same.
{10:11} And he sayde vnto the: Who so euer putteth awaye his wife, & marieth another, breaketh wedlocke to her warde.
{10:12} And yf a woma forsake hir hussbande, & be maried to another, she comitteth aduoutrie.
{10:13} And they brought childre vnto him, that he might touch them. But the disciples reproued those that brought the.
{10:14} Neuertheles whan Iesus sawe it, he was displeased, and sayde vnto them: Suffre the children to come vnto me, and forbyd them not, for of soch is the kyngdome of God.
{10:15} Verely I saye vnto you: Who so euer receaueth not the kyngdome of God as a childe, he shal not entre therin.
{10:16} And he toke them vp in his armes, and layed his handes vpon them, and blessed them.
{10:17} And whan he was gone forth vpon the waye, there came one runninge, and kneled vnto him, & axed him: Good Master, what shal I do, that I maye inheret euerlastinge life?
{10:18} But Iesus saide vnto him: Why callest thou me good? There is no man good, but God onely,
{10:19} Thou knowest the commaundementes: Thou shalt not breake wedlocke: thou shalt not kyll: thou shalt not steale: thou shalt beare no false wytnesse: thou shalt begyle no man: Honoure thy father and mother.
{10:20} But he answered, and sayde vnto him: Master, all these haue I kepte fro my youth vp.
{10:21} And Iesus behelde him, and loued him, & sayde vnto him: Thou wantest one thinge: Go thy waye, and sell all that thou hast, and geue it vnto ye poore: so shalt thou haue a treasure in heauen, and come & folowe me, and take the crosse vpon ye.
{10:22} And he was disconforted at the sayenge, & wente awaye sory, for he had greate possessions.
{10:23} And Iesus loked aboute him, and sayde vnto his disciples: O how hardly shal the ryche come into ye kyngdome of God?
{10:24} And the disciples were astonnyed at his wordes. But Iesus answered agayne, and sayde vnto them: Deare children, how harde is it for them that trust in riches, to come into the kyngdome of God?
{10:25} It is easier for a Camell to go thorow the eye of a nedle, then for a rich man to entre in to ye kyngdome of God.
{10:26} Yet were they astonnyed ye more, and sayde amonge the selues: Who can the be saued?
{10:27} But Iesus behelde them, and sayde: With men it is vnpossyble, but not with God: for with God all thinges are possyble.
{10:28} Then sayde Peter vnto him: Beholde, we haue forsaken all, and folowed the.
{10:29} Iesus answered & sayde: Verely I saye vnto you: There is no man that forsaketh house, or brethren, or sisters, or father or mother, or wife, or children, or londes for my sake and the gospels,
{10:30} that shal not receaue an hundreth folde now in this tyme, houses, and brethre, and sisters, and mothers and children, and londes with persecucions, and in the worlde to come euerlastinge life.
{10:31} But many that are the first, shal be the last: and the last the first.
{10:32} They were in the waye goinge vp to Ierusalem, and Iesus wente before them. And they were astonnyed, and folowed him, and were afrayed. And Iesus toke the twolue agayne, and tolde them what shulde happe vnto him.
{10:33} Beholde, we go vp to Ierusalem, and the sonne of man shalbe delyuered vnto the hye prestes and scrybes, and they shal condemne him to death, and delyuer him vnto the Heythe.
{10:34} And they shal mocke hi, and scourge him, and spyt vpon him, and put him to death, and on the thirde daye shal he ryse agayne.
{10:35} Then wete vnto him Iames and Ihon ye sonnes of Zebede, and sayde: Master, We desyre, that what soeuer we axe of the, thou wilt do it for vs.
{10:36} He sayde vnto the: What desyre ye that I shal do to you?
{10:37} They sayde vnto him: Graunte vs, that we maye syt one at thy right hande, and one at thy left hande in thy glory.
{10:38} But Iesus sayde vnto the: Ye wote not what ye axe. Maye ye drynke the cuppe, yt I shal drynke? and be baptysed with the baptyme that I shal be baptysed withall?
{10:39} They sayde vnto him: Yee yt we maye. Iesus sayde vnto them: The cuppe that I drynke, shal ye drynke in dede: and be baptysed with the baptyme that I shall be baptysed withall.
{10:40} Neuertheles to syt at my right hande and at my left, is not myne to geue you, but vnto them for whom it is prepared.
{10:41} And wha the ten herde that, they disdayned at Iames and Ihon.
{10:42} But Iesus called them, and sayde vnto them: Ye knowe that the prynces of ye worlde haue domynacion of the people, and ye mightie exercise auctorite amonge them.
{10:43} So shal it not be amonge you: but who so euer wil be greate amoge you, shal be youre mynister:
{10:44} and who so wyl be chefest amonge you, shalbe seruaunt of all.
{10:45} For the sonne of man also came not to be serued, but to do seruyce, and to geue his life to a redempcion for many.
{10:46} And they came vnto Iericho. And whan he wente out of Iericho, and his disciples, and moch people, there sat one blynde Barthimeus the sonne of Thimeus by ye waye, and begged.
{10:47} And wha he herde that it was Iesus of Nazareth, he beganne to crie and saye: Iesu thou sonne of Dauid haue mercy vpon me.
{10:48} And many reproued him, that he shulde holde his tunge. But he cried moch more: Thou sonne of Dauid haue mercyvpo me.
{10:49} And Iesus stode styll, and bad call him. And they called the blynde, and sayde vnto him: Be of good conforte, aryse, he calleth the.
{10:50} And he cast awaye his garment from him, stode vp, aud came to Iesus.
{10:51} And Iesus answered, & sayde vnto him: What wilt thou that I do vnto the? The blynde sayde vnto him: Master, that I might se.
{10:52} Iesus sayde vnto him: Go yi waye, thy faith hath helped ye. And immediatly he had his sight and folowed him in the waye.
{11:1} And whan they came nye Ierusalem to Bethphage and Bethanye vnto mount Oliuete, he sent two of his disciples,
{11:2} and sayde vnto them: Go in to the towne that lyeth before you, and as soone as ye come in, ye shal fynde a foale bounde, wher vpon no man hath sytte: lowse it, and brynge it hither.
{11:3} And yf eny man saye vnto you: wherfore do ye that? Then saye ye: The LORDE hath nede therof, and forth with he shal sende it hither.
{11:4} They wete their waie and founde the foale tyed by ye dore without at the partynge of the waye, and lowsed it.
{11:5} And certayne of those yt stode there, axed them: What do ye, that ye lowse the foale?
{11:6} But they sayde vnto the, like as Iesus had commaunded them. And so they let them alone.
{11:7} And they brought the foale vnto Iesus, and layed their clothes theron, and he sat theron.
{11:8} But many spred their garmetes in the waye: some cut downe braunches fro the trees, and strowed the in the waye.
{11:9} And they that wente before, and that folowed after, cried, and sayde: Hosyanna, blessed be he, that commeth in the name of the LORDE:
{11:10} blessed be the kyngdome of oure father Dauid, which commeth in the name of the LORDE. Hosyanna in the height.
{11:11} And the LORDE entred in to Ierusalem, and wente in to the temple, and loked vpon all. And at euen he wente out vnto Bethany with the twolue:
{11:12} and on the morow wha they departed from Bethanye, he hugred,
{11:13} and sawe a fygge tre afarre of, which had leaues. Then came he nye, (to se) yf he coude fynde eny thinge theron.And whan he came to it, he founde nothinge but leaues (for the tyme of fygges was not yet)
{11:14} And Iesus answered, and sayde vnto it: Neuer ma eate frute of the for euermore. And his disciples herde it.
{11:15} And they came to Ierusalem. And Iesus wente in to the temple, and beganne to dryue out the sellers and byers in the teple, & ouerthrew the tables of the money chaungers, and the stoles of the doue sellers,
{11:16} and suffred not eny man to cary a vessell thorow the temple.
{11:17} And he taught and sayde vnto them: Is it not wrytten: My house shalbe called a house of prayer for all people? But ye haue made it a denne of murthurers.
{11:18} And the scrybes and hye prestes herde of it. And they sought how they might destroye him, but they were afrayed of him, for all the people marueled at his doctryne.
{11:19} And at euen he wente out of the cite.
{11:20} And on the morow they passed by, and sawe the fygge tre, that it was wythred vnto the rote.
{11:21} And Peter thought theron, and sayde vnto him: Master, beholde, the fygge tre yt thou cursedest, is wythred awaye.
{11:22} Iesus answered, and sayde vnto them: Haue faith in God.
{11:23} Verely I saye vnto you: Who so euer saieth vnto this mountayne: Avoyde, and cast thy self in to the see, and douteth not in his hert, but beleueth that the thinges shal come to passe which he saieth, then loke what he sayeth, it shal come to passe.
{11:24} Therfore I saye vnto you: What so euer ye desyre in youre prayer, beleue that ye shal receaue it, and ye shal haue it.
{11:25} And whan ye stonde and praye, forgeue yf ye haue ought ageynst eny man, that youre father also in heauen, maye forgeue you youre trespaces.
{11:26} KJV: But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses
{11:27} And they came agayne vnto Ierusalem and whan he wente in the temple, there came vnto him the hye prestes and scrybes and the elders,
{11:28} and sayde vnto him: By what auctorite dost thou these thinges? and who gaue the this auctorite to do soch?
{11:29} But Iesus answered and sayde vnto the: I wil axe you a worde also, answere me, and I wyl tell you, by what auctorite I do these.
{11:30} The baptyme of Ihon, was it from heauen, or of men? Answere me.
{11:31} And they thought in them selues: yf we saye, it was from heauen, then shal he saye: Why dyd ye not then beleue him?
{11:32} But yf we saye: It was of men, then feare we the people, for they all helde that Ihon was a true prophet.
{11:33} And they answered, and saide vnto him: We can not tell. And Iesus answered, and sayde vnto them: Nether tell I you, by what auctorite I do these thinges.
{12:1} And he beganne to speake vnto them by parables: A certayne ma planted a vynyarde, and made a hedge aboute it, and dygged a wynne presse, and buylded a tower, and let it out vnto hussbande men, and wente in to a straunge countre.
{12:2} And whan the tyme was come, he sent a seruaut to the hussbande men, that he might receaue of the hussbandmen, of the frute of the vynyarde.
{12:3} But they toke him, and bet him, and sent him awaye emptye.
{12:4} Agayne, he sent vnto them another seruaunt, whom they stoned, and brake his heade, and sent him awaye shamefully dealt withall.
{12:5} Agayne he sent another, whom they slew, and many other: some they bett, and some they put to death.
{12:6} Then had he yet one sonne onely, whom he loued, him he sent also vnto them at the last, and sayde: they wyl stonde in awe of my sonne.
{12:7} But the same hussbandmen sayde amonge them selues: This is the heyre, Come, let vs kyll him, so shal the inheritaunce be ours.
{12:8} And they toke him, and slewe him, and cast him out of the vynyarde.
{12:9} What shal now the lorde of the vynyarde do? He shal come and destroye the hussbande men, and geue the vynyarde vnto other.
{12:10} Haue ye not red this scripture: The same stone which the buylders refused, is become the headstone in the corner?
{12:11} This was the LORDES doynge, and it is maruelous in oure eyes.
{12:12} And they wente aboute to take him (but they feared the people) for they perceaued, that he had spoke this parable agaynst the. And they left him, and wente their waye.
{12:13} And they sent vnto him certayne of the Pharises and Herodes officers to take him in his wordes.
{12:14} And they came, and sayde vnto hi: Master, we knowe that thou art true and carest for no man. For thou regardest not the outwarde appearaunce of men, but teachest ye waye of God truly. Is it laufull to geue tribute vnto the Emperoure, or not?
{12:15} Ought we to geue it, or ought we not to geue it? But he perceaued their ypocrisye, and sayde vnto them: Why tempte ye me? Brynge me a peny, that I maye se it.
{12:16} And they brought it him. Then sayde he: Whose ymage and superscripcion is this? They sayde vnto him: The Emperours.
{12:17} Then answered Iesus and sayde vnto the: Geue therfore vnto the Emperoure that which is the Emperours, and vnto God that which is Gods. And they marueled at him.
{12:18} Then came vnto him the Saduces (which holde that there is no resurreccion) these axed him, and sayde:
{12:19} Master, Moses wrote vnto vs. Yf eny mans brother dye, and leaue a wife, and leaue no children, his brother shal take his wife, and rayse vp sede vnto his brother.
{12:20} Now were there seuen brethren: the first toke a wife, and dyed, and left no sede:
{12:21} and the seconde toke her, and dyed, and left no sede also: the thirde in like maner.
{12:22} And they all seuen toke her, and left no sede. At the last after them all, the wyfe dyed also.
{12:23} Now in the resurreccion whan they shal ryse agayne, whose wife shal she be of them? For seuen had her to wife.
{12:24} Then answered Iesus, and sayde vnto them: Do not ye erre? because ye knowe not the scryptures ner ye power of God?
{12:25} Whan they shal ryse agayne from the deed, they shal nether mary ner be maried, but they are as the angels in heauen.
{12:26} As touchinge the deed, that they shal ryse agayne, haue ye not red in the boke of Moses, how God spake vnto him in the bush, and sayde: I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, & the God of Iacob?
{12:27} Yet is not God a God of the deed, but of the lyuynge. Therfore ye erre greatly.
{12:28} And there came vnto him one of the scrybes, that had herkened vnto the how they disputed together, and sawe that he had answered them well, and axed him: Which is the chefest comaundement of all?
{12:29} Iesus answered him: The chefest commaundemet of all commaundementes is this: Heare O Israel, the LORDE oure God is one God,
{12:30} and thou shalt loue the LORDE thy God with all thy hert, with all thy soule, with all thy mynde, and with all thy strength. This is the chefest commaundement,
{12:31} and the seconde is like vnto it: Thou shalt loue thy neghboure as thy self. There is none other greater commaundement then these.
{12:32} And the scrybe sayde vnto him: Master, Verely thou hast sayde right: for there is but one God, & there is none other without him,
{12:33} and to loue him with all the hert, with all the mynde, with all the soule, and with all the strength, and to loue a mans neghboure as himself, is more then brent sacrifices and all offerynges.
{12:34} But wha Iesus sawe that he answered discretly, he sayde vnto him: Thou art not farre from the kyngdome of God. And after this durst no man axe him eny mo questions.
{12:35} And Iesus answered, and sayde, whan he taught in the temple: How saye the scrybes, yt Christ is the sonne of Dauid?
{12:36} But Dauid himself saieth thorow the holy goost: The LORDE sayde vnto my LORDE: Syt thou on my right honde, tyll I make thine enemies yi fotestole.
{12:37} There Dauid calleth him his LORDE. How is he the his sonne? And many people herde him gladly.
{12:38} And he taught the, and sayde vnto the: Bewarre of the scrybes, that loue to go in longe garmentes, and loue to be saluted in the market,
{12:39} and syt gladly aboue in the synagoges and at the table:
{12:40} they deuoure wyddowes houses, and vnder a coloure they make longe prayers. These shal receaue the more damnacion.
{12:41} And Iesus sat ouer agaynst the Gods chest, and behelde how the people put money in to the Godschest. And many that were riche: put in moch.
{12:42} And there came a poore wyddowe, and put in two mytes, which make a farthinge.
{12:43} And he called vnto him his disciples, and sayde vnto them: Verely I saye vnto you: this poore wyddowe hath put more in ye Godschest, then all they that haue put in:
{12:44} For they all haue put i of their superfluyte, but she of hir pouerte hath put in all that she had, euen hir whole lyuynge.
{13:1} And whan he wete out of the temple, one of his disciples sayde vnto him: Master, se, what stones and what a buyldinge is this?
{13:2} And Iesus answered and sayde vnto him: Seist thou all this greate buyldinge? There shal not one stone be left vpo another, yt shal not be broken downe.
{13:3} And whan he sat vpon mount Oliuete ouer ageynst the temple, Peter and Iames, and Ihon, and Andrew axed him pryuatly:
{13:4} Tell vs, Whan shal all these come to passe? And what shalbe the toke, wha all these shalbe fulfilled?
{13:5} Iesus answered them, and beganne to saye: Take hede, that no man disceaue you,
{13:6} for there shal many come vnder my name, and saye: I am Christ, & shal disceaue many.
{13:7} But whan ye shal heare of the noyse of warres, be not ye afrayed: for so must it be, but ye ende is not yet.
{13:8} One people shal ryse ageynst another, and one realme ageynst another, and there shal be earth quakes here and there, and derth shal there be and troubles. These are the begynnynge of sorowes.
{13:9} But take ye hede to youre selues. For they shal delyuer you vp to the councels, and synagoges, and ye shal be beaten, and shalbe brought before prynces and kynges for my namessake, for a wytnesse vnto the.
{13:10} And ye gospel must first be preached amoge all people.
{13:11} Now whan they shal lede you and delyuer you vp, take ye no thought afore what ye shal saye: and ymagyn ye nothinge afore hande, but what so euer shal be geue you at the same houre, that speake: for it is not ye that speake, but the holy goost.
{13:12} One brother shal delyuer another vnto death, and the father the sonne, & the children shal ryse ageynst their fathers and mothers, and shal helpe them to death,
{13:13} and ye shal be hated of all men for my names sake. But who so endureth to the ende, shalbe saued.
{13:14} Whan ye shal se the abhominacio of desolacion (wherof it is spoke by Daniel the prophet) stonde where it ought not (who so readeth it, let him marck it well) then let the which be in Iewry, flye vnto the mountaynes:
{13:15} and let him that is on the house toppe not descede in to the house, ner come therin, to fetch eny thinge out of the house.
{13:16} And let him that is in the felde, not turne backe to fetch his clothes.
{13:17} But wo vnto them that are with childe, and to them that geue suck in those dayes.
{13:18} Neuertheles praye ye, that youre flight be not in the wynter.
{13:19} For in those dayes there shal be soch trouble as was not from the begynnynge of ye creatures which God created, vnto this tyme, nether shal be.
{13:20} And yf ye LORDE had not shortened those dayes, there shulde no man be saued. But for the electes sake whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened those dayes.
{13:21} Now yf eny man shal saye vnto you at yt tyme: Lo, here is Christ: lo, he is there, beleue it not.
{13:22} For there shal aryse false Christes, and false prophetes, which shal do tokens & wonders, to disceaue euen the very chosen, yf it were possyble.
{13:23} But take ye hede, Beholde, I haue tolde you all before.
{13:24} But at the same tyme after this trouble, the Sonne and Mone shal lose their light,
{13:25} and the starres shall fall from heauen, and the powers of the heauens shal moue:
{13:26} and then shal they se the sonne of man commynge in the cloudes with greate power and glory.
{13:27} And the shal he sende his angels, and shal gather together his chosen fro the foure wyndes, from one ende of the earth to the other.
{13:28} Lerne a symilitude of the fyge tre: Wha his braunch is yet teder, and hath brought forth leaues, ye knowe that the Sommer is nye.
{13:29} So lykewyse wha ye se all these thinges come to passe, be ye sure, that it is nye euen at the dores.
{13:30} Verely I saye vnto you: this generacio shal not passe, tyll all these be fulfilled.
{13:31} Heauen and earth shal perishe, but my wordes shal not perishe.
{13:32} But of that daye and houre knoweth no man, nether the angels in heauen, no not the sonne him self, but the father onely.
{13:33} Take hede, watch, & praye, for ye knowe not whan the tyme is.
{13:34} Like as a man that wente in to a straunge countre, and left his house, and gaue his seruauntes auctorite, vnto euery one his worke, and commaunded ye porter, that he shulde watch.
{13:35} Watch ye therfore, for ye knowe not wha the master of ye house cometh, whether he cometh in the euenynge, or at mydnight, or aboute the cock crowynge, or in the mornynge
{13:36} that he come not sodenly, and fynde you slepynge.
{13:37} Loke what I saye vnto you, that saye I vnto all. Watch.
{14:1} And after two dayes was Easter, and the daies of swete bred. And ye hye prestes & scrybes sought how they might take him with disceate, & put him to death.
{14:2} But they sayde: Not in the feast daye, lest there be an vproure in the people.
{14:3} And when he was at Bethanye in the house of Symon the leper, and sat at the table, there came a woman, which had a boxe of pure and costly Nardus oyntment. And she brake ye boxe, & poured it vpo his heade.
{14:4} Then were there some, yt disdayned and sayde: Where to serueth this waist?
{14:5} This oyntment might haue bene solde for more then thre hundreth pens, & bene geue to ye poore. And they grudged agaynst her.
{14:6} But Iesus sayde: let her be in rest. Why trouble ye her? She hath done a good worke vpo me.
{14:7} Ye haue allwaye the poore with you, and wha so euer ye wil, ye maye do the good: but me haue ye not allwaie.
{14:8} She hath done what she coulde, she is come before, to anoynte my body for my buriall.
{14:9} Verely I saye vnto you: Where so euer this gospell shalbe preached in all the worlde, there shal this also that she hath now done, be tolde for a remembraunce of her.
{14:10} And Iudas Iscarioth one of the twolue wente vnto the hye prestes, to betraye him vnto them.
{14:11} Whan they herde yt, they were glad, & promysed that they wolde geue him money. And he sought, how he might coueniently betraye him.
{14:12} And vpon ye first daye of swete bred, wha the Easter lambe was offered, his disciples sayde vnto him: Where wilt thou yt we go and prepare, yt thou mayest eate ye Easter labe?
{14:13} And he sent two of his disciples, and sayde vnto them: Go youre waye into the cite, and there shal mete you a ma bearinge a pitcher with water, folowe him,
{14:14} & where so euer he goeth in, there saye ye to the good man of the house: The Master sendeth the worde: Where is the gest house, wherin I maye eate the Easter labe, wt my disciples?
{14:15} And he shal shewe you a greate parlour, which is paued & prepared, there make readye for vs.
{14:16} And ye disciples wete forth, & came in to ye cite, & foude it as he had sayde vnto the. And they prepared ye Easter lambe.
{14:17} At euen he came wt the twolue.
{14:18} And as they sat at the table & ate, Iesus sayde: Verely I saye vnto you: One of you yt eateth wt me, shal betraye me.
{14:19} And they were sory, & sayde vnto hi one after another: Is it I? & another (sayde:) is it I?
{14:20} He answered & saide vnto the: One of the twolue, euen ye same yt dyppeth with me in ye platter.
{14:21} The sonne of man truly goeth forth, as it is wrytte of hi. But wo vnto that ma, by whom the sonne of man is betrayed. It were better for the same man, that he had neuer bene borne.
{14:22} And as they ate, Iesus toke the bred, gaue thankes, & brake it, and gaue it the, & sayde: Take, eate, this is my body.
{14:23} And he toke the cuppe, thaked, and gaue it the, and they all dranke therof.
{14:24} And he sayde vnto them: This is my bloude of the new Testament, which shalbe shed for many.
{14:25} Verely I saye vnto you, that from hence forth I wil not drynke of the frute of the vyne, tyll ye daye yt I drynke it new in ye kyngdome of God.
{14:26} And wha they had sayde grace, they wete forth vnto mount Oliuete.
{14:27} And Iesus sayde vnto them: This night shal ye all be offended in me, for it is wrytten: I wil smyte the sheperde, & the shepe shal be scatred abrode.
{14:28} Neuertheles after yt I am rysen agayne, I wil go before you in to Galile.
{14:29} But Peter sayde vnto him: And though all men shulde be offended, yet wolde not I be offended.
{14:30} And Iesus sayde vnto him: Verely I saye vnto ye: Todaye in this same night, before ye cock crowe two tymes, shalt thou denye me thryse.
{14:31} But he saide yet more: Yee though I shulde dye wt ye, yet wil I not denie ye. So saide they all i like maner.
{14:32} And they came in to ye felde called Gethsemane, and he saide vnto his disciples: Syt ye here, tyll I go yonder, and praye.
{14:33} And he toke with him Peter & Iames, & Ihon, and begane to waxe fearefull, & to be in an agonye,
{14:34} & sayde vnto the: My soule is heuy eue vnto ye death: tary ye here and watch.
{14:35} And he wente forth a litle, fell vpon the grounde and prayed, that, (yf it were possyble) ye houre might passe fro him,
{14:36} and sayde: Abba, my father, all thinges are possyble vnto the, take this cuppe awaye fro me: Neuertheles not what I wyl, but what thou wilt.
{14:37} And he came vnto them, and founde the slepynge, and sayde vnto Peter: Symon, slepest thou? Couldest thou not watch with me one houre?
{14:38} Watch and praye, that ye fal not in to temptacion. The sprete is wyllinge, but ye flesh is weake.
{14:39} And he wete forth agayne, and prayde, and spake the same wordes,
{14:40} and returned, and founde them slepynge agayne: for their eyes were heuy, & they knewe not what they shulde answere him.
{14:41} And he came the thirde tyme, and sayde vnto them: Slepe on now, and take youre rest, It is ynough, the houre is come: beholde, ye sonne of man shalbe delyuered in to the handes of synners:
{14:42} aryse, let vs be goynge. Beholde, he is at hande, that betrayeth me.
{14:43} And immediatly whyle he yet spake, came Iudas one of the twolue, and with him a greate multitude, with swerdes and staues from the hye prestes and scrybes and elders.
{14:44} And the traytoure had geuen them a toke, and sayde: Whom so euer I kysse, that same is he, laye handes vpon him, and lede him awaye warely.
{14:45} And wha he was come, he wente straight waye vnto him, and sayde vnto him: O master, master, and kyssed him.
{14:46} Then layed they their handes vpon him, & toke him.
{14:47} But one of the that stode by, drew out his swerde, and smote the hye prestes seruaunt, and cut of his eare.
{14:48} And Iesus answered, and sayde vnto the: Ye are come forth as it were to a murthurer with swerdes and with staues to take me.
{14:49} I was daylie with you in the temple, and taught, and ye toke me not. But this is done, that the scrypture maye be fulfilled.
{14:50} And all the disciples forsoke him, and fled.
{14:51} And there folowed him a yonge ma, which was clothed in lynnen vpon the bare skynne, and the yonge me toke holde of him.
{14:52} But he let the lynnen go, and fled naked from them.
{14:53} And they led Iesus vnto the hye prest, where all ye hye prestes, and elders and scrybes were come together.
{14:54} As for Peter, he folowed him a farre of in to the hye prestes palace. And he was there, and sat with the seruauntes, and warmed him.
{14:55} But the hye prestes and the whole councell sought wytnesse agaynst Iesus, yt they might brynge him to death, and they founde none.
{14:56} Many gaue false wytnesse agaynst him, but their wytnesses agreed not together.
{14:57} And some stode vp, and gaue false wytnes agaynst him, and sayde:
{14:58} We herde him saye: I wil breake downe this temple that is made with hodes, and in thre dayes buylde another not made wt handes.
{14:59} But their wytnesse agreed not together.
{14:60} And the hye prest stode vp amonge them, and axed Iesus, and sayde: Answerest thou nothinge vnto it, that these testifie agaynst the?
{14:61} But he helde his tunge, and answered nothinge. The the hye prest axed him agayne, and sayde vnto him: Art thou Christ the sonne of the blessed?
{14:62} Iesus sayde: I am. And ye shal se the sonne of man syt at the right hande of power, and come in the cloudes of heaue.
{14:63} Then the hye prest rent his clothes, & sayde: What nede we eny mo wytnesses?
{14:64} Ye haue herde the blasphemy. What thynke ye? They all codemned him, that he was giltie of death.
{14:65} Then beganne there some to spyt vpo him, and to couer his face, and to smyte him with fistes, and to saye vnto him Prophecie vnto vs. And the seruauntes smote him on the face.
{14:66} And Peter was beneth in ye palace. The came one of the wenches of the hye prest:
{14:67} And wha she sawe Peter warmynge him, she loked vpo hi, and sayde: And thou wast with Iesus of Nazareth also.
{14:68} But he denyed, & sayde: I knowe him not, nether can I tell what thou sayest. And he wente out in to the fore courte, and the cock crew.
{14:69} And a damsell sawe him, and beganne agayne to saye vnto them that stode by: This is one of them.
{14:70} And he denyed it agayne. And after a litle whyle they yt stode by, sayde agayne vnto him: Of a trueth thou art one of them for thou art a Galilean, and thy speach soundeth euen alike.
{14:71} But he begane to curse and sweare: I knowe not the man, that ye speabe of.
{14:72} And the cock crew agayne.Then thought Peter vpon the worde, that Iesus sayde vnto him: Before ye cock crow two tymes, thou shalt denye me thryse. And he beganne to wepe.
{15:1} And soone in the mornynge the hye prestes helde a councell wt the elders and scrybes and the whole councell, & bounde Iesus, and led him awaye, and delyuered him vnto Pylate.
{15:2} And Pylate axed him: Art thou the kynge of the Iewes? He answered, and sayde vnto him: Thou sayest it.
{15:3} And the hye prestes accused him sore.
{15:4} But Pylate axed him agayne, and sayde: Answerest thou nothinge? Beholde, how sore they laye to yi charge.
{15:5} Neuertheles Iesus answered nomore, in so moch yt Pylate marueyled.
{15:6} At that feast of Easter he was wonte to delyuer vnto them a presoner, whom so euer they wolde desyre.
{15:7} There was i preson with the sedicious, one called Barrabas, which in the vproure had committed murthur.
{15:8} And the people wente vp, and prayed him, that he wolde do, as he was wonte.
{15:9} Pylate answered them: wyl ye that I geue lowse vnto you the kynge of the Iewes?
{15:10} For he knew, that ye hye prestes had delyuered him of envye.
{15:11} But the hye prestes moued ye people, that he shulde rather geue Barrabas lowse vnto them.
{15:12} Pylate answered agayne, and sayde vnto them: What wil ye the that I do vnto him, whom ye accuse to be kynge of the Iewes?
{15:13} They cried agayne: Crucifie hi.
{15:14} Pylate sayde vnto the: What euell hath he done? But they cried yet moch more: Crucifie him.
{15:15} So Pylate thought to satisfie the people, and gaue Barrabas lowse vnto them, and delyuered the Iesus, to be scourgd & crucified.
{15:16} And the soudyers led him in to the como hall, and called the whole multitude together,
{15:17} and clothed him with purple, and plated a crowne of thorne, and crowned him withall,
{15:18} and beganne to salute him: Hayle kynge of the Iewes.
{15:19} And smote him vpon the heade with a rede, and spytted vpo him, and fell vpo the kne, & worshipped him.
{15:20} And wha they had mocked him, they toke ye purple of him, and put his clothes vpon him, & led him out, that they might crucifye him.
{15:21} And they compelled one that passed by, called Symon of Cyren (which came from the felde, and was the father of Alexander and Ruffus) to beare his crosse.
{15:22} And they brought him to the place Golgatha, which is by interpretacion: a place of deed mens skulles.
{15:23} And they gaue him wyne myxted wt myrre, to drynke, & he toke it not.
{15:24} And whan they had crucified him, they parted his garmetes, & cast lottes therfore, what euery one shulde take.
{15:25} And it was aboute ye thirde houre, & they crucified him.
{15:26} And the tytle of his cause was wrytte ouer aboue him (namely:) The kynge of the Iewes.
{15:27} And they crucified him wt two murtherers, one at ye right hande, and one at the left.
{15:28} Then was the scrypture fulfilled, which sayeth: He was couted amonge the euell doers.
{15:29} And they that wete by, reuyled him, and wagged their heades, and sayde: Fye vpon the, how goodly breakest thou downe ye teple, & buyldest it agayne in thre dayes?
{15:30} Helpe yi self now, & come downe fro the crosse.
{15:31} The hye prestes also in like maner laughed him to scorne amonge the selues, with the scrybes, & sayde: He hath helped other, himself can he not helpe.
{15:32} Yf he be Christ and ye kynge of Israel, let him come downe now fro the crosse, yt we maye se it, & beleue. And they yt were crucified wt hi, checked hi also.
{15:33} And wha it was aboute the sixte houre, there was a darcknesse ouer the whole lode, tyll aboute ye nyenth houre.
{15:34} And aboute ye nyenth houre Iesus cried loude, and sayde: Eli, Eli, lamma asabthani? which is interpreted: My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
{15:35} And some that stode by, whan they herde yt, they sayde: Beholde, he calleth Elias.
{15:36} Then rane there one, & fylled a spoge wt vyneger, & stickte it vpo a rede, & gaue hi to drynke, & sayde: Holde styll, let se, whether Elias wil come, and take him downe.
{15:37} But Iesus cried loude, and gaue vp the goost.
{15:38} And the vale of the teple rent in two peces, from aboue tyll beneth.
{15:39} The captayne that stode thereby ouer agaynst him, wha he sawe yt he gaue vp the goost with soch a crye, he sayde: Verely this man was Gods sonne.
{15:40} And there were wemen there also, which behelde this afarre of, amoge who was Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Iames ye litle, & the mother of Ioses, & Salome,
{15:41} which had folowed him wha he was in Galile, and mynistred vnto hi: & many other yt wete vp wt hi to Ierusalem.
{15:42} And at euen (for so moch as it was the daye of preparinge, which is the fore Sabbath)
{15:43} there came one Ioseph of Arimathia, a worshipfull Senatoure (which loked also for the kyngdome of God) & wete in boldely vnto Pilate, & axed ye body of Iesus.
{15:44} But Pylate marueyled yt he was deed all ready, & called ye captayne, & axed hi, whether he had loge bene deed.
{15:45} And wha he had gotten knowlege of the captayne, he gaue Ioseph ye body.
{15:46} And he bought a lynne cloth, & toke him downe, & wrapped hi in ye lynne clothe, & layed him in a sepulcre, which was hewe out of a rocke, & rolled a stone before ye dore of ye sepulcre.
{15:47} But Mary Magdalene and Mary Ioses behelde, where he was layed.
{16:1} And whan the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, & Mary Iames, and Salome, bought spyces, yt they might come, & anoynte hi.
{16:2} And they came to the sepulcre vpo a daye of ye Sabbathes very early, wha ye Sonne arose,
{16:3} & sayde one to another: Who shal rolle vs ye stone fro ye dore of the sepulcre?
{16:4} And whan they loked, they sawe, that the stone was rolled awaye: for it was a very greate one.
{16:5} And they wente in to the sepulcre, and on the right hande they sawe a yonge man syttinge, which had a longe whyte garmet vpon him, and they were abasshed.
{16:6} But he sayde vnto the: Be not ye afrayed, ye seke Iesus of Nazareth which was crucified: he is rysen, he is not here. Beholde, ye place, where they layed him.
{16:7} But go ye youre waye, and tell his disciples and Peter, that he wil go before you in to Galile, there shal ye se him as he sayde vnto you.
{16:8} And they wente forth in all the haist, and fled from the sepulcre: for there was a tremblynge & feare come vpon them, nether sayde they eny thinge to eny man, for they were afrayed.
{16:9} But Iesus, whan he was rysen vp early vpo the first daye of the Sabbathes, he appeared first vnto Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast out seuen deuels.
{16:10} And she wete and tolde the that were with him, as they mourned and wepte.
{16:11} And whan they herde that he lyued, and had appeared vnto her, they beleued it not.
{16:12} After warde as two of the were walkynge, he shewed himself vnder another figure, whan they were goynge vpon the felde.
{16:13} And they wente, and tolde the other: these they beleued not also.
{16:14} At the last, as the eleuen sat at the table, he shewed himself vnto them, and rebuked their vnbeleue, and ye hardnesse of their hert, because they beleued not the which had sene him rysen.
{16:15} And he sayde vnto them: Go ye youre waye in to all the worlde, and preach the gospell vnto all creatures.
{16:16} Who so beleueth and is baptysed, shalbe saued: but who so beleueth not, shalbe damned.
{16:17} As for the tokens, which shal folowe the that beleue, these are they: In my name shal they cast out deuyls: Speake with new tunges:
{16:18} Dryue awaye serpetes: And yf they drynke eny deedly thinge, it shal not hurte them: They shal laye their handes vpo the sicke, and they shal recouer.
{16:19} And the LORDE, after that he had spoken vnto them, was taken vp in to heauen, and sytteth at the right hade of God.
{16:20} And they wente out, and preached euery where. And the LORDE wrought with them, and confirmed the worde with tokens folowynge.

{1:1} These are ye names of the childre of Israel, that came with Iacob into Egipte: euery one came in wt his house,
{1:2} Ruben, Simeon, Leui, Iuda,
{1:3} Isachar, Zabulo, Ben Iamin,
{1:4} Dan, Nephtali, Gad and Aser.
{1:5} And of all the soules that came out of the loynes of Iacob, there were seuentie. As for Ioseph, he was in Egipte all ready.
{1:6} Now wha Ioseph was deed, and all his brethren, and all they that lyued at that tyme,
{1:7} the children of Israel grewe, and increased, and multiplied, and became exceadinge mightie, so yt the lande was full of them.
{1:8} The came there a new kynge ouer Egipte, which knewe nothinge of Ioseph,
{1:9} and sayde vnto his people: Beholde, the people of the children of Israel are many, & mightier then we:
{1:10} Vp, let vs deale wysely with them, yt there be not so many of them. For yf there shulde ryse vp eny warre agaynst vs, they might ioyne them selues also vnto oure enemies, and ouercome vs, & so get them out of the lande.
{1:11} And he set worke masters ouer them, to kepe them vnder with burthens. (For they buylded the cities Phiton and Raemses, for treasuries vnto Pharao.)
{1:12} But the more they vexed them, the more they multiplied and grew.Therfore had they indignacio at the children of Israel,
{1:13} and the Egipcians compelled the children of Israel without mercy to do seruyce,
{1:14} and made their lyues bytter vnto them with greuous laboure in claye and brycke, and with allmaner of bondage in ye felde, and with allmaner of laboure, which they layed vpon them without mercy.
{1:15} And the kynge of Egipte sayde vnto the mydwyues of the Hebrueswemen. (Of the which one was called Siphra, and the other Pua:)
{1:16} Whan ye helpe the wemen of the Hebrues, and se vpon the stole, that it is a sonne, then slaye him: but yf it be a doughter, let her lyue.
{1:17} Neuertheles the mydwyues feared God, & dyd not as the kinge of Egipte commaunded them, but let the children lyue.
{1:18} Then the kynge of Egipte called the mydwyues, and sayde vnto them: Wherfore do ye this, that ye let the children lyue?
{1:19} The mydwyues answered Pharao: The wemen of the Hebrues are not as the wemen of Egipte, for they are sturdy wemen: or euer the mydwyues come at them, they are delyuered.
{1:20} Therfore God dealt well with the mydwyues. And the people multiplied, and became exceadinge mightie.
{1:21} And for so moch as the mydwyues feared God, he made them houses.
{1:22} Then Pharao commauded all his people and sayde: All the sonnes that are borne, cast in to the water, but let all the doughters lyue.
{2:1} And there wente forth a man of the house of Leui, and toke a doughter of Leui.
{2:2} And the wife conceaued and bare a sonne. And whan she sawe yt it was a proper childe, she hyd him thre monethes.
{2:3} And whan she coude hyde him no longer, she toke an Arke of redes, and dawbed it ouer with slyme and pitch, and layed the childe therin, and set it amonge the redes by the waters brynke.
{2:4} But his sister stode a farre of, to wete what wolde come of him.
{2:5} And Pharaos doughter came downe, to wash herself in the water: And hir maydens walked by the water syde: and whan she sawe the Arke amonge the redes, she sent one of hir maydens, and caused it to be fett.
{2:6} And whan she opened it, she sawe ye childe: and beholde the babe wepte. Then had she pytie vpon it, and sayde: It is one of the Hebrues children.
{2:7} Then sayde his syster vnto Pharaos doughter: Shal I go, and call the a nurse of the Hebrues wemen, to nurse ye the childe?
{2:8} Pharaos doughter sayde vnto her: Go thy waye. The mayde wente, and called the childes mother.
{2:9} Then sayde Pharaos doughter vnto her: Take this childe, and nurse it for me, I wyll geue ye thy rewarde. The woman toke the childe, and nursed it.
{2:10} And whan the childe was growne, she brought it vnto Pharaos doughter, and it became hir sonne, and she called him Moses. For she sayde: I toke him out of the water.
{2:11} Vpon a tyme whan Moses was greate, he wente forth vnto his brethren, and loked vpon their burthens, and sawe, that an Egipcia smote one of his brethren ye Hebrues.
{2:12} And he loked rounde aboute him: and whan he sawe that there was no man, he slew the Egipcian, and buried him in the sonde.
{2:13} The next daye he wente forth also, and sawe two men of the Hebrues stryuynge together, and sayde to the vngodly: Wherfore smytest thou thy neghboure?
{2:14} But he sayde: Who made the a ruler or iudge ouer vs? Wilt thou slaye me also, as thou slewest the Egipcian? The was Moses afrayed, and sayde: How is this knowne?
{2:15} And Pharao herde of it, and sought for Moses, to slaye him. But Moses fled from Pharao, and kepte him in the lande of Madian, and sat him downe by a wells syde.
{2:16} The prest Madian had seuen doughters, which came to drawe water, and fylled the troughes, to geue their fathers shepe to drinke.
{2:17} Then came the shepherdes, and droue the awaye. But Moses gat him vp, and helped them, and gaue their shepe to drynke.
{2:18} And whan they came to Reguel their father, he saide: How came ye so soone to daie?
{2:19} They sayde: A man of Egipte delyuered vs from ye shepherdes, and drew vnto vs, and gaue the shepe to drynke.
{2:20} He sayde vnto his doughters. Where is he? Wherfore let ye the man go, that ye called him not to eate with vs?
{2:21} And Moses was content to dwell with the man. And he gaue Moses his doughter Zipora,
{2:22} which bare him a sonne, and he called him Gerson, for he sayde: I am become a straunger in a straunge lande.
{2:23} And she bare him yet a sonne, whom he called Elieser, and sayde: The God of my father is my helper, and hath delyuered me from Pharaos hade.But after this in processe of tyme, the kynge of Egipte dyed. And the childre of Israel sighed ouer their laboure, and cried.
{2:24} And their crye ouer their labor, came before God. And God herde their coplaynte, & remebred his couenaunt with Abraham Isaac and Iacob.
{2:25} And God loked vpon the childre of Israel, and God knew it.
{3:1} Moses kepte the shepe of Iethro his father in lawe prest of Madian, & droue the shepe on the backsyde of the wyldernes, and came to the mountayne of God, Horeb.
{3:2} And the angell of ye LORDE appeared vnto him in a flame of fyre out of the bush. And he sawe that ye bush brent wt fyre, and yet was not consumed,
{3:3} and saide: I wil go hence, and se this greate sight, why ye bush is not brent.
{3:4} Whan the LORDE sawe, that he wente his waye to se, God called vnto him out of the bush, and sayde: Moses, Moses. He answered: Here am I.
{3:5} He sayde: Come not hither, put thy shues of thy fete, for the place where vpon thou stondest, is an wholy groude.
{3:6} And he sayde morouer: I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, ye God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob. And Moses couered his face, for he was afrayed to loke vpon God.
{3:7} And the LORDE sayde: I haue sene the trouble of my people in Egipte & haue herde their crye ouer those that oppresse them. I knowe their sorowe,
{3:8} and am come downe to delyuer them from the power of the Egipcians, and to carye them out of that lode, in to a good and wyde londe, euen in to a londe that floweth with mylke and hony: namely, vnto the place of the Cananites, Hethites, Amorites, Pheresites, Heuytes & Iebusites.
{3:9} For so moch now as the complaynte of the children of Israel is come before me, & I haue sene their oppression wherwith the Egipcians oppresse them:
{3:10} Go now yi waye therfore, I wil sende the vnto Pharao, that thou mayest brynge my people the children of Israel out of Egipte.
{3:11} Moses sayde vnto God: Who am I, yt I shulde go vnto Pharao, and brynge the children of Israel out of Egipte?
{3:12} He sayde: I wyll be with the: & this shall be the token, yt I haue sent the. Whan thou hast brought my people out of Egipte, ye shal serue God vpon this mountayne.
{3:13} Moses sayde vnto God: Beholde, whan I come to the childre of Israel, and saye vnto them: The God of youre fathers hath sent me vnto you, & they saye vnto me: What is his name? what shal I saye vnto them?
{3:14} God saide vnto Moses: I wyl be what I wyll be. And he sayde: Thus shalt thou saye vnto ye children of Israel: I wyl he hath sent me vnto you.
{3:15} And God sayde morouer vnto Moses: Thus shalt thou saye vnto the children of Israel: The LORDE God of youre fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, ye God of Iacob hath sent me vnto you, this is my name for euer, and my memoriall from childe to childes childe.
{3:16} Go thy waye therfore, and gather the elders of Israel tother, and saye vnto them: The LORDE God of youre fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Iacob hath appeared vnto me, and sayde: I haue vysited you, and sene what is done vnto you in Egipte,
{3:17} and haue sayde: I wil brynge you out of the trouble of Egipte, in to ye lande of ye Cananites, Hethites, Amorites, Pheresites, Heuites & Iebusites: in to a lode yt floweth with mylke and hony.
{3:18} And yf they heare yi voyce, then shalt thou and the elders of Israel go in to the kynge of Egipte, and saye vnto him: The LORDE God of ye Hebrues hath called vs. Let vs go now therfore thre dayes iourney in the wyldernes, yt we maye do sacrifice vnto the LORDE oure God.
{3:19} But I knowe, that the kynge of Egipte wil not let you go, but thorow a mightie hade.
{3:20} For I will stretch out myne hande, & smyte Egipte wt all maner of wonders which I will do therin: after yt shal he let you go.
{3:21} And I wil geue this people fauoure in the sight of the Egipcians: so that whan ye go forth, ye shal not go forth emptie:
{3:22} but euery wife shall borowe of hir neghbouresse & of her that sogeourneth in hir house, Iewels of syluer and golde and rayment: those shal ye put vpon youre sonnes and doughters, and spoyle the Egipcians.
{4:1} Moses answered, & sayde: Beholde, they shall not beleue me, ner heare my voyce, but shal saye: The LORDE hath not appeared vnto the.
{4:2} The LORDE sayde vnto him: What is yt, that thou hast in thine hande? He saide a staff.
{4:3} He sayde: Cast it from the vpon the grounde. And he cast it fro him: then was it turned to a serpent. And Moses fled fro it.
{4:4} But ye LORDE saide vnto him: Stretch forth thine hande, & take it by the tayle. Then stretched he forth his hande, and toke it, and it became a staff agayne in his hande.
{4:5} Therfore shal they beleue that ye LORDE God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac ye God of Iacob hath appeared vnto the.
{4:6} And the LORDE sayde furthermore vnto him: Thrust thine hade in to yi bosome. And he thrust it in to his bosome, & toke it out: beholde, the was it leper like snowe.
{4:7} And he saide: Put it in to yi bosome agayne. And he put it agayne in to his bosome, & toke it out: beholde, the was it turned againe as his flesh.
{4:8} Yf they wil not beleue the, ner heare ye voyce of the first token, yet shal they beleue the voyce of the seconde token.
{4:9} But yf they wil not beleue these two tokens ner heare thy voyce, then take of the water of the ryuer, and poure it vpon the drye londe: so shall the same water yt thou hast take out of ye ryuer, be turned vnto bloude vpo ye drye londe.
{4:10} But Moses sayde vnto the LORDE: Oh my LORDE, I am a man yt is not eloquet, from yesterdaye & yeryesterdaye, & sence the tyme yt thou hast spoken vnto thy seruaunt: for I haue a slowe speach, & a slowe tunge.
{4:11} The LORDE sayde vnto him: Who hath made the mouth of man? Or who hath made the domme, or the deaf, or the seynge or ye blynde? Haue not I the LORDE done it?
{4:12} Go now thy waye therfore, I wil be wt thy mouth, & teach the what thou shalt saye.
{4:13} But Moses sayde: My LORDE, sende whom thou wilt sende.
{4:14} Then was the LORDE very angrie at Moses, and saide: Do not I knowe then, yt thy brother Aaron the Leuite is well spoken? And beholde, he shal go forth to mete ye: & whan he seyth the, he shal reioyse from his hert.
{4:15} Thou shalt speake vnto him, & put the wordes in his mouth: & I wil be with thy mouth & his, and teach you what ye shall doo:
{4:16} & he shall speake vnto the people for the. He shal be thy mouth, & thou shalt be his God.
{4:17} And take in thine hande this staff, wherwith thou shalt do tokens.
{4:18} Moses wete, and came agayne vnto Iethro his father in lawe, and sayde vnto him: Let me go (I praye the) that I maye turne agayne vnto my brethre, which are in Egipte, and se whether they be yet alyue. Iethro sayde vnto him: Go thy waye in peace.
{4:19} The LORDE sayde also vnto him in Madian: Go yi waye, turne againe in to Egipte, for ye me are deed, that sought after thy life.
{4:20} So Moses toke his wife, and his sonnes, and caried them vpon an Asse, & wente againe into the lande of Egipte, & toke the staff of God in his hande.
{4:21} And the LORDE saide vnto Moses: When thou comest agayne in to Egipte, se yt thou do all the wonders (before Pharao) which I haue put in yi hade. But I wil harde his hert, yt he shall not let the people go.
{4:22} And thou shalt saie vnto Pharao: Thus sayeth ye LORDE: Israel is my first borne sonne,
{4:23} & I saye vnto the: Let my sonne go, yt he maye serue me: Yf thou wilt not let him go, then wil I slaye thy firstborne sonne.
{4:24} And as he was by the waye in the Inne, the LORDE met him, and wolde haue slayne him.
{4:25} Then toke Zipora a stone, and circumcyded the foreskynne of hir sonne, and touched his fete, and sayde: A bloudy brydegrome art thou vnto me.
{4:26} The let he him go. But she sayde: A bloudy brydegrome, because of the circumcision.
{4:27} And the LORDE sayde vnto Aaron: Go mete Moses in the wildernes. And he wete, & met him on the mount of God, and kyssed him.
{4:28} And Moses tolde Aaron all the wordes of the LORDE, which had sent him: & all the tokens yt he had charged him with all.
{4:29} And they wete, & gathered all the elders of the childre of Israel.
{4:30} And Aaron tolde all ye wordes, yt the LORDE had spoke vnto Moses: & dyd the tokens before the people,
{4:31} & the people beleued. And whan they herde yt the LORDE vysited the children of Israel, and loked vpon their trouble, they bowed them selues, and worshipped.
{5:1} Afterwarde wente Moses & Aaron, & spake vnto Pharao: Thus sayeth the LORDE the God of Israel: let my people go, yt they maye kepe holy daye vnto me in the wildernes.
{5:2} Pharao answered: What felowe is the LORDE, that I must heare his voyce, and let Israel go?
{5:3} I knowe not the LORDE, nether wil I let Israel go.They sayde: The God of the Hebrues hath called vs. Let vs go now therfore thre dayes iourney in the wildernes, & do sacrifice vnto the LORDE or God, yt there happen not vnto vs pestilece or swerde.
{5:4} The sayde ye kynge of Egipte vnto the: Why make ye ye people (thou Moses & Aaron) to leaue their worke? Get you hece to yor laboure.
{5:5} Pharao saide morouer: Beholde, ye people are to many in ye lande, and yet wil ye byd them ceasse from their laboure.
{5:6} The same daye therfore dyd Pharao comaunde the workmasters of the people, and their officers, and sayde:
{5:7} Ye shal not gather and geue the people eny more strawe, to burne bryck, as yesterdaye and yeryesterdaye. Let them go, and gather them strawe them selues.
{5:8} And the nombre of the brycke which they made yesterdaye & yeryesterdaye, shall ye laye vpon them neuertheles, and mynish nothinge therof: for they are ydle. Therfore crye they and saye: We wil go, and do sacrifice vnto oure God.
{5:9} Let the men be kepte downe wt laboure, yt they maye haue to do, & not to turne them selues to false wordes.
{5:10} Then wente the workmasters of the people & their officers out, & spake vnto the people: Thus sayeth Pharao: There shall no strawe be geuen you,
{5:11} go youre waye youre selues, and get you strawe, where ye can fynde it. But of youre labor there shall nothinge be mynished.
{5:12} Then were the people scatred in all ye lande of Egipte, to gather stubble, that they might haue strawe.
{5:13} And the workmasters haistied them forwarde, & sayde: Fulfill yor daye worke, like as whan ye had strawe.
{5:14} And the officers of ye children of Israel, whom Pharaos worckmasters had set ouer them, were beaten, & it was saide vnto them: Wherfore haue ye not fulfilled yor appoynted daye worke to daye and yesterdaye, like as in tymes past?
{5:15} Than wente the officers of the children of Israel, & coplayned vnto Pharao: Wherfore wilt thou deale thus wt thy seruauntes?
{5:16} Thy seruauntes haue no strawe geuen the, & yet must we make the brycke that are appoynted vs. And beholde, thy seruauntes are beaten, & thy people are euell intreated.
{5:17} Pharao sayde: Ye are ydle, ydle are ye, therfore saye ye: we will go, and do sacrifice vnto the LORDE.
{5:18} Go now yor waye therfore, & worke: there shall no strawe be geuen you, but the nombre of brycke shal ye delyuer.
{5:19} Then sawe the officers of the children of Israel, yt it was not amended, for it was sayde: ye shal mynish nothinge of the daye worke of the brycke.
{5:20} And whan Moses & Aaron wente from Pharao, they came forth to mete them,
{5:21} & sayde vnto them: The LORDE loke vpon you, & iudge it, for ye haue made the sauoure of vs to stynke before Pharao and his seruauntes, and haue geuen them a swerde in their handes, to slaye vs.
{5:22} But Moses came agayne vnto the LORDE, and sayde: LORDE, wherfore dealest thou so euell wt this people? Wherfore hast thou sent me?
{5:23} For sence the tyme that I wente in vnto Pharao, to speake vnto him in thy name, he hath dealt euell with this people, and thou hast not delyuered yi people.
{6:1} The LORDE sayde vnto Moses: Now shalt thou se, what I will do vnto Pharao, for thorow a mightie hande must he let them go, thorow a mightie hande must he dryue them from him out of his londe.
{6:2} And God spake vnto Moses, & sayde vnto him: I am ye LORDE,
{6:3} & I appeared vnto Abraham, Isaac & Iacob, an Allmightie God: but my name, LORDE, haue I not shewed vnto them:
{6:4} My couenaunt also haue I made with them, that I wil geue them the londe of Canaan, the londe of their pilgremage, wherin they haue bene straungers.
{6:5} Morouer I haue herde the complaynte of the children of Israel, whom ye Egipcians oppresse with laboure, and haue remembred my couenaunt.
{6:6} Therfore saye vnto the childre of Israel: I am the LORDE, & wil brynge you out from yor burthens in Egipte, & wil rydd you from youre laboure, and wil delyuer you thorow a stretched out arme & greate iudgmetes,
{6:7} and will receaue you for my people, & will be yor God: so that ye shal knowe, that I the LORDE am yor God, which brynge you out from the burthen of Egipte,
{6:8} and will brynge you into the lande, ouer the which I haue lift vp my hande, to geue it vnto Abraham, Isaac and Iacob, ye same wil I geue vnto you for a possession. I the LORDE.
{6:9} Moses tolde this vnto the childre of Israel. But they herkened not vnto him, for very anguysh of sprete, & for sore laboure.
{6:10} The spake the LORDE vnto Moses, & sayde:
{6:11} Go thy waye, & speake vnto Pharao the kynge of Egypte, yt he let the childre of Israel go out of his lande.
{6:12} But Moses spake before ye LORDE, & saide: Beholde, ye childre of Israel herke not vnto me, how shulde Pharao the heare me? And I am also of vncircumcised lyppes.
{6:13} So the LORDE spake vnto Moses & Aaron, & gaue the a commaundemet vnto the childre of Israel, & vnto Pharao the kynge of Egipte, yt they shulde brynge the childre of Israel out of Egipte.
{6:14} These are ye heades of the house of their fathers. The children of Ruben the first sonne of Israel, are these: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, Charmi: These are the generacions of Ruben.
{6:15} The children of Simeon are these: Iemuel, Iamin, Ohad, Iachin, Zophar, and Saul the sonne of the Cananitish woman: These are the generacions of Symeon.
{6:16} These are the names of the childre of Leui in their generacios: Gerson, Rahath and Merari: Leui was an hundreth and seuen & thirtie yeare olde.
{6:17} The children of Gerson are these: Libni and Semei in their generacions.
{6:18} The childre of Rahath are these: Amram, Iezear, Hebron, Usiel. Rahath was an hundreth & thre & thirtie yeare olde.
{6:19} The children of Merari are these: Maheli and Musi. These are ye generacions of Leui in their kynreds.
{6:20} And Amram toke his vncles doughter Iochebed to wife, which bare him Aaron & Moses. Amram was an C. & vij. & thirtie yeare olde.
{6:21} The childre of Iezear are these: Korah, Nepheg, Sichri.
{6:22} The children of Vsiel are these: Misael, Elzaphan, Sithri.
{6:23} Aaron toke Elizaba ye doughter of Aminadab Nahassons sisters to wife, which bare him Nadab, Abihu, Eleasar, Ithamar.
{6:24} The childre of Korah are these: Assir, Elkana, & Abiassaph. These are ye generacios of ye Korahites.
{6:25} Eleasar Aarons sonne toke one of the doughters of Putiel to wife, which bare him Phineas. These are the heades amonge the fathers of the generacions of the Leuites.
{6:26} This is yt Aaron & Moses, vnto whom ye LORDE sayde: Bringe ye childre of Israel out of the lande of Egipte wt their armies.
{6:27} It is they (namely Moses & Aaron) yt spake vnto Pharao the kynge of Egipte, yt they might brynge the children of Israel out of Egipte.
{6:28} The same daie spake ye LORDE vnto Moses in ye lande of Egipte,
{6:29} & sayde: I am ye LORDE, speake thou vnto Pharao ye kynge of Egipte, all yt I saye vnto ye.
{6:30} And he answered before ye LORDE: Beholde, I am of vncircumcised lippes, how shall Pharao the heare me?
{7:1} The LORDE sayde vnto Moses: Beholde, I haue made the a God ouer Pharao, & Aaro yi brother shal be yi prophet.
{7:2} Thou shalt speake all yt I comaude ye: but Aaron yi brother shal speake vnto Pharao, yt he maye let the childre of Israel go out of his lande.
{7:3} Neuertheles I wil harden Pharaos hert, yt I maye multiplye my tokens & wonders in the londe of Egipte.
{7:4} And Pharao shal not heare you, yt I maye shewe my hande in Egipte, & brynge myne armyes, euen my people the childre of Israel out of ye lande of Egipte, by greate iudgmetes.
{7:5} And ye Egipcians shal knowe, yt I am the LORDE, whan I shal stretch out my hande vpon Egipte, and brynge the children of of Israel out from amonge the.
{7:6} Moses and Aaron dyd as the LORDE comauded them.
{7:7} And Moses was foure score yeare olde, & Aaron thre & foure score yeare olde, whan they spake vnto Pharao.
{7:8} And ye LORDE sayde vnto Moses & Aaron:
{7:9} Whan Pharao sayeth vnto you: Shew youre wonders, then shalt thou saye vnto Aaron: Take thy staff, and cast it before Pharao, & it shal turne to a serpent.
{7:10} Then wete Moses & Aaron in vnto Pharao, & dyd as the LORDE comaunded them. And Aaron cast his staff before Pharao & before his seruauntes, & it turned to a serpet.
{7:11} Then Pharao called for ye wyse men & Sorcerers. And the Sorcerers of Egipte also dyd like wyse with their Sorceries,
{7:12} and euery one cast his staff before him, & they turned vnto serpentes. But Aarons staff deuoured their staues.
{7:13} So Pharaos hert was hardened, and he herkened not vnto them, euen as the LORDE had sayde.
{7:14} And the LORDE sayde vnto Moses: The hert of Pharao is hardened, he refuseth to let ye people go.
{7:15} Get ye vnto Pharao in the mornynge, beholde, he shal come vnto ye water, mete thou him vpo the waters brynke, & take ye staff which turned to a serpet, in thine hande,
{7:16} & saye vnto him: The LORDE God of the Hebrues hath sent me vnto the, & sendeth ye worde: Let my people go, that they maye serue me in the wyldernesse: but hither to thou woldest not heare.
{7:17} Therfore thus sayeth the LORDE: Hereby shalt thou knowe, yt I am ye LORDE. Beholde, wt the staff yt I haue in my hande, wil I smyte the water which is in ye ryuer, & it shalbe turned in to bloude:
{7:18} so that the fishes in the ryuer shall dye, & the ryuer shall stynke: & it shall greue the Egipcians to drynke of ye water of the ryuer.
{7:19} And ye LORDE spake vnto Moses: Saye vnto Aaron: Take yi staff, & stretch out thine hade ouer ye waters of Egipte, ouer their ryuers & brokes & pondes, & ouer all water poles, yt they maye be turned to bloude, & that there maye be bloude in all ye lande of Egipte, both in vessels of wodd and stone.
{7:20} Moses & Aaron dyd as ye LORDE comaunded them, & lift vp the staff, & smote the water yt was in the ryuer, before Pharao & his seruauntes, & all the water in the ryuer was turned into bloude,
{7:21} & the fysh in the ryuer dyed, & the ryuer stanke, so yt the Egipcians coulde not drynke of the water of ye ryuer, & there was bloude in all the lande of Egipte.
{7:22} And the Sorcerers also of Egipte, dyd likewyse with their Sorceries. But Pharaos hert was hardened, & he herkened not vnto the, like as the LORDE had sayde.
{7:23} And Pharao turned himself, & wente home, & set not his hert there on.
{7:24} All the Egipcias dygged roude aboute ye ryuer, for water to drinke: for they coude not drynke of ye water out of the ryuer.
{7:25} And this endured seuen dayes longe, that the LORDE smote the ryuer.
{8:1} The LORDE sayde vnto Moses: Go yi waye to Pharao, & speake vnto him: Thus saieth the LORDE: Let my people go, yt they maye serue me:
{8:2} Yf thou wilt not let the go, beholde, I wil smyte all ye borders of yi lode wt frogges,
{8:3} so yt the ryuer shal scraule wt frogges: these shal clymme vp, & come in to thine house, in to yi chamber, where thou slepest, vpon thy bed, and in to the houses of thy seruauntes, amonge thy people, in to thine ouens, and vpon thy dowe:
{8:4} and the frogges shall come vp vpon the, and vpon thy people, and vpon all thy seruauntes.
{8:5} And the LORDE spake vnto Moses: Saie vnto Aaron: Stretch forth thine hande wt thy staff ouer the streames, & ryuers, & pondes, and let frogges come vpon the londe of Egipte.
{8:6} And Aaron stretched his hade ouer the waters in Egipte, & there came vp frogges, so yt the londe of Egipte was couered.
{8:7} The Sorcerers also dyd likewyse, wt their Sorcerirs, & caused frogges to come vpo ye lode of Egipte.
{8:8} The called Pharao for Moses & Aaron, & sayde: Praye the LORDE for me, yt he maye take awaye the frogges fro me & fro my people, & I will let ye people go, yt they maye do sacrifice vnto the LORDE.
{8:9} Moses sayde: Haue thou the honor before me, & appoynte me, wha I shal praye for ye, for yi seruauntes and for thy people: yt the frogges maye be dryuen awaye fro the & fro thy house, & remayne onely in the ryuer.
{8:10} He sayde: Tomorow. He sayde: Euen as thou hast sayde, yt thou mayest knowe, yt there is none like vnto the LORDE or God:
{8:11} And the frogges shal be take from the, & from yi house, from thy seruauntes, & from thy people, & remayne onely in the ryuer.
{8:12} So Moses & Aaron wete from Pharao, & Moses cried vnto the LORDE for the appoyntment ouer the frogges, which he had promysed vnto Pharao.
{8:13} And ye LORDE dyd as Moses sayde. And the frogges dyed in ye houses, in ye courtes, & vpon ye felde:
{8:14} & they gathered the together, here an heape, & there an heape, & the lande stanke of them.
{8:15} But whan Pharao sawe yt he had gotten breth, his hert was hardened, and he herkened not vnto the, euen as the LORDE had sayde.
{8:16} And the LORDE spake vnto Moses: Saie vnto Aaron: Stretch out thy staff, & smyte the dust vpon the earth, yt there maye be lyfe in the whole lode of Egipte.
{8:17} They dyd so. And Aaron stretched out his hande wt his staff, & smote the dust vpon the earth, & there were lyse vpon men and vpon catell: All the dust of the lande was turned vnto lyse in all the lande of Egipte.
{8:18} The Sorcerers also assayde likewyse wt their Sorcerirs yt they might brynge forth lyse, but they coude not. And ye lyse were vpon men & catell.
{8:19} Then sayde ye Sorcerers vnto Pharao: It is the fynger of God. But Pharaos hert was hardened, & he herkened not vnto the, euen as the LORDE had sayde.
{8:20} And ye LORDE saide vnto Moses: Get ye vp tomorow by tymes, & stonde before Pharao: beholde, he wil go vnto the water, & speake thou vnto him: Thus saieth ye LORDE: let my people go, yt they maye serue me:
{8:21} yf not, beholde, I wil cause cruell wormes (or flyes) to come vpon the, thy seruauntes, yi people, & thy house, so yt all the Egipcians houses, & the felde, and what theron is shall be full of cruell wormes:
{8:22} & the same daye wil I separate the londe of Gosen, wherin my people are, so yt no cruell worme shalbe there, that thou mayest knowe, that I am ye LORDE in the myddest of the earth.
{8:23} And I wil set a delyueraunce betwene my people and thyne. Tomorow shal this token come to passe.
{8:24} And the LORDE dyd so. And there came perlous cruell wormes in to Pharaos house, in to his seruauntes houses, & vpon all the londe of Egipte: and the londe was marred with noysome wormes.
{8:25} The called Pharao for Moses & Aaron, & sayde: Go yor waye, & do sacrifice vnto yor God in ye londe.
{8:26} Moses sayde: It is not mete, yt we shulde so do, so shulde we offer ye abhominacion of ye Egipcians vnto the LORDE or God. Beholde, yf we shulde offer the abhominacion of ye Egipcians before their eyes, shulde they not stone vs?
{8:27} Thre dayes iourney will we go in the wyldernes, and do sacrifice vnto the LORDE oure God like as he hath sayde vnto vs.
{8:28} Pharao sayde: I wil let you go, yt ye maie do sacrifice vnto the LORDE yor God in the wyldernes (onely yt ye go no farther) & praye for me.
{8:29} Moses sayde: Beholde, whan I am come forth from ye, I wil praye vnto ye LORDE, yt the cruell wormes maye be taken from Pharao, & from his seruautes, & fro his people, euen tomorow: onely disceaue me nomore, that thou woldest not let the people go to do sacrifice vnto the LORDE.
{8:30} And Moses wete out from Pharao, and prayed vnto the LORDE.
{8:31} And the LORDE dyd as Moses sayde, & toke awaye the cruell wormes from Pharao, from his seruauntes, and from his people, so yt there remayned not one.
{8:32} But Pharao hardened his hert eue then also, and let not ye people go.
{9:1} The LORDE sayde vnto Moses: Go in to Pharao, and speake vnto him: Thus sayeth the LORDE God of ye Hebrues: let my people go, yt they maye serue me.
{9:2} Yf thou wilt not, but holde them longer,
{9:3} beholde, the hande of the LORDE shalbe vpon thy catell in the felde, vpon horses, vpon Asses, vpon Camels, vpon oxen, vpon shepe with a very sore pestilence.
{9:4} And ye LORDE shall make a diuysion betwene the catell of the Israelites & the Egipcians, so yt there shal nothinge dye of all that the children of Israel haue.
{9:5} And ye LORDE appoynted a tyme, and sayde: Tomorow shal the LORDE do this vpon earth.
{9:6} And the LORDE dyd the same on the morow. And there dyed of all maner of catell of the Egipcians: but of ye catell of ye childre of Israel there dyed not one.
{9:7} And Pharao sent thither, & beholde, there was not one of the catell of Israel deed. But Pharaos hert was hardened, so yt he let not ye people go.
{9:8} Then sayde ye LORDE vnto Moses & Aaron: Take youre handes full of asshes out of the fornace, & let Moses sprenkle it towarde heauen before Pharao,
{9:9} that it maye be dust in all the lande of Egipte, & that there maye be sores & blaynes vpon men & vpon catell in all the lande of Egipte.
{9:10} And they toke asshes out of ye fornace, & stode before Pharao, & Moses sprenkled it towarde heaue. Then were there sores and blaynes vpon men & vpon catell,
{9:11} so that the Sorcerers might not stode before Moses by reason of the sores. For there were sores vpo the Sorcerers as well as vpon all the Egipcians.
{9:12} But the LORDE hardened Pharaos hert, so that he herkened not vnto them, eue as the LORDE had sayde vnto Moses.
{9:13} Then sayde the LORDE vnto Moses: Get the vp tomorow by tymes, & stonde before Pharao, & speake vnto him: Thus sayeth ye LORDE God of the Hebrues: let my people go, yt they maye serue me,
{9:14} els wyll I at this tyme sende all my plages in to thine hert, & vpon thy seruautes & vpon thy people: that thou mayest knowe, yt there is none like me in all londes.
{9:15} For I will now stretch out my hande, & smyte the & thy people wt pestilence, so yt thou shalt be roted out from the earth.
{9:16} Yet haue I stered ye vp for this cause, euen to shew my power vpon ye, and that my name might be declared in all londes.
{9:17} Thou holdest my people yet, & wilt not let them go,
{9:18} beholde, tomorow aboute this tyme wyll I cause a mightie greate hayle to rayne, soch as hath not bene in the londe of Egipte, sence the tyme that it was grouded, hither to.
{9:19} And now sende thou, & saue thy catell, & all yt thou hast in the felde: for all men & catell that shalbe founde in the felde, & not brought in to the houses, yf the hayle fall vpon them, they shall dye.
{9:20} Now who so feared the worde of the LORDE amonge Pharaos seruauntes, caused his seruauntes & catell to flye in to the houses:
{9:21} but loke whose hertes regarded not the worde of ye LORDE, left their seruauntes and catell in the felde.
{9:22} Then sayde the LORDE vnto Moses: Strech out thy hande towarde heaue, that it maye hayle vpon all the lande of Egipte, vpon men, vpon catell, & vpon all herbes of the felde in the lande of Egipte.
{9:23} So Moses stretched out his staff towarde heauen, and the LORDE caused it to thonder & hayle, so yt the fyre ranne alonge vpon the earth. Thus the LORDE hayled & rayned vpon the londe of Egipte,
{9:24} so that the hayle & fyre wente so horrybly together, as neuer was in all the lade of Egipte, sens the tyme that there were people therin.
{9:25} And the hayle smote the whole lande of Egipte, all that was vpon ye felde, both men & catell, & smote all the herbes vpon the felde, & brake all the trees vpon ye felde,
{9:26} saue onely in the lande of Gosen, where the childre of Israel were, there it hayled not.
{9:27} Then sent Pharao & called for Moses & Aaron, & sayde vnto them: Now haue I synned, ye LORDE is righteous, but I & my people are vngodly.
{9:28} Yet praye ye vnto the LORDE, that the thonder & hayle of God maye ceasse, then wyl I let you go, that ye shal tary here no longer.
{9:29} Moses sayde vnto him: Whan I am come out of the cite, I wyll stretch out myne handes vnto the LORDE, so shal the thonder ceasse, & there shal be nomore hayle: that thou mayest knowe, that the earth is the LORDES.
{9:30} But I knowe, yt both thou & thy seruauntes feare not yet the LORDE God.
{9:31} Thus the flax and the barlye were smytten: for the barlye was shot vp, & ye flax was boulled:
{9:32} but the wheate and ye rye were not smytten, for they were late sowen.
{9:33} So Moses wente from Pharao out of ye cite, & stretched out his hades vnto ye LORDE. And ye thoder & the hayle ceassed, & the rayne dropped not vpo the earth.
{9:34} But wha Pharao sawe yt the rayne & thonder & hayle ceassed, he synned agayne, and herdened his hert, he & his seruauntes.
{9:35} So Pharaos hert was hardened, yt he let not the childre of Israel go, eue as the LORDE had sayde by Moses.
{10:1} And the LORDE saide vnto Moses: Go in vnto Pharao, for I haue hardened his hert & the hertes of his seruautes, yt I might do these my tokes amonge the,
{10:2} & that thou mightest shewe it in the eares of thy children & of thy childers children, what I haue done in Egipte, and how I haue shewed my tokens amoge the, that ye maye knowe, how that I am the LORDE.
{10:3} So Moses & Aaron wente in vnto Pharao, & spake vnto him: Thus sayeth ye LORDE God of the Hebrues: How longe refusest thou to submyt thy self vnto me, to let my people go, yt they maye serue me?
{10:4} Yf thou wilt not let my people go, beholde, tomorow wil I cause greshoppers to come vpon all places,
{10:5} yt they maye couer the lande, so yt the lande can not be sene, & they shal eate vp yt is left you & was delyuered fro the hayle: & shal eate vp all yor grene trees vpon the felde,
{10:6} & shal fyll thy house, all yi seruautes houses, & all the Egipcians houses: soch as yi fathers & yi fathers fathers haue not sene, sens the tyme yt they were vpon earth vnto this daye. And he turned him, & wente out from Pharao.
{10:7} Then saide Pharaos seruauntes vnto him: How longe shall we be snared after this maner? Let the men go, that they may serue ye LORDE their God. Knowest thou not yet, yt Egipte is destroyed?
{10:8} Moses & Aaron were brought agayne to Pharao, which saide vnto them: Go yor waye, & serue ye LORDE yor God. But who are they yt shall go?
{10:9} Moses sayde: We wil go wt yonge & olde, wt sonnes and doughters, with shepe and oxe: for we haue a feast of the LORDE.
{10:10} He sayde vnto the: Let it be so, the LORDE be with you: Shulde I let you go & yor childre also? loke that ye haue not some myschefe in hade.
{10:11} Not so, but go ye that are men, and serue the LORDE, for that was youre desyre. And they thrust them out from Pharao.
{10:12} The saide ye LORDE vnto Moses: Stretch out thine hande ouer ye londe of Egipte, for the greshoppers, yt they maye come vpo ye londe of Egipte, & eate vp all the herbes in the londe, wt all yt escaped the hayle.
{10:13} Moses stretched out his staff ouer ye lande of Egipte, & the LORDE brought an east wynde in to the londe all yt daye & all yt night, & in the mornynge, the east wynde brought the greshoppers.
{10:14} And they came ouer the whole lande of Egipte, and lighted in all places of Egipte, so exceadinge many, that before tyme there were neuer soch, nether shalbe here after:
{10:15} for they couered the londe, and made it darcke. And they ate vp all the herbes in ye londe, & all the frutes vpon the trees which remayned from ye hayle, & left no grene thinge behinde in the trees & herbes vpon the felde in all the lande of Egipte.
{10:16} Then Pharao called for Moses & Aaron in all ye haist, & saide: I haue synned against the LORDE yor God, & agaynst you:
{10:17} forgeue me my synne this once also, & pray the LORDE yor God, yt he maye take awaye fro me this death onely.
{10:18} And he wete out from Pharao, & prayed vnto the LORDE.
{10:19} The the LORDE turned a maruelous stroge west wynde, and toke vp the greshoppers, & cast them in to the reed see, so that there was not one left in all the quarters of Egipte.
{10:20} But the LORDE hardened Pharaos hert, that he let not the childre of Israel go.
{10:21} The LORDE sayde vnto Moses: Stretch out thine hade towarde heauen, that it be so darck in the londe of Egipte, yt it maye be felt.
{10:22} And Moses stretched out his hade towarde heauen, the was there a thicke darcknesse in all the londe of Egipte thre dayes,
{10:23} so yt in thre dayes no ma sawe another, nor rose vp from ye place where he was. But wt the childre of Israel there was light in their dwellinges.
{10:24} Then Pharao called for Moses, & sayde: Go yor waye & serue the LORDE: onely leaue yor shepe & yor oxen here: let yor childre go wt you also.
{10:25} Moses sayde: Thou must geue vs offringes and brentofferynges, that we maye do sacrifice vnto the LORDE or God.
{10:26} Oure catell shal go wt vs, and there shal not one hooffe be left behynde: for we must take therof for the seruyce of the LORDE or God. Morouer we knowe not wherwithall we shal serue ye LORDE, tyll we come thither.
{10:27} But the LORDE hardened Pharaos hert, yt he wolde not let them go.
{10:28} And Pharao sayde vnto him: Get the hence fro me, & bewarre, that thou come nomore in my sight: For loke what daie so euer thou comest in my sight, thou shalt dye.
{10:29} Moses answered: Eue as thou hast sayde, I wil come nomore in thy sight.
{11:1} And the LORDE sayde vnto Moses: I wil yet brynge a plage vpon Pharao and Egipte: after yt shal he let you go from hence, & shal not onely let all go, but also dryue you hence.
{11:2} Therfore saye now vnto the people, yt euery man borowe of his neghboure, & euery woman of his neghbouresse, Iewels of syluer & golde:
{11:3} for the LORDE shal geue the people fauor in the sight of ye Egipcias. And Moses was a very greate man in the lande of Egipte, in ye sight of Pharaos seruauntes, & in the sight of the people.
{11:4} And Moses sayde: Thus sayeth the LORDE: At mydnight wil I go out in the lande of Egipte,
{11:5} & all ye first borne in the lande of Egipte shall dye: from Pharaos first sonne (yt sytteth vpon his seate) vnto the first sonne of the mayde seruaunte which is behynde ye myll: & all the first borne amonge the catell:
{11:6} & there shalbe a greate crie in all the lande of Egipte, soch as neuer was, ner shalbe.
{11:7} But amonge all the childre of Israel there shall not a dogg quatch wt his tonge, fro men vnto catell, yt ye maye knowe, how yt the LORDE hath put a differece betwixte Egipte & Israel.
{11:8} The shal all these thy seruauntes come downe vnto me, & fal at my fote, & saye: Get the out, thou & all the people that are vnder the. After that wyl I departe. And he wete fro Pharao wt a wroth full displeasure.
{11:9} The LORDE saide vnto Moses: Pharao herkeneth not vnto you, yt many woders maye be done in ye lade of Egipte.
{11:10} And Moses & Aaron dyd all these woders before Pharao: but ye LORDE hardened his hert, yt he wolde not let ye childre of Israel go out of his londe.
{12:1} The LORDE sayde vnto Moses & Aaron in the londe of Egipte:
{12:2} This moneth shal be with you ye first moneth & at it ye shall begynne the monethes of the yeare.
{12:3} Speake ye vnto all the congregacion of Israel, & saye: Vpon ye tenth daye of this moneth let euery one take a labe (or a kydd) where a housholder is, to euery house a labe.
{12:4} But yf the housholde be to few for a lambe, the let him & his neghbor yt is next vnto his house, take it acordinge to the nombre of ye soules, and counte to the lambe, what euery man maye eate.
{12:5} But it shal be a lambe without blemish, a male, & of a yeare olde. From amonge the lambes & goates shal ye take it.
{12:6} And ye shal kepe it vnto ye fourtene daye of the moneth. And euery man of the congregacion of Israel shal slaye it aboute the eueninge.
{12:7} And they shal take of his bloude, and stryke it on both the syde postes of the dore, and on the vpperdore post of the house, that they eate it in.
{12:8} And so shal they eate flesh ye same night, rosted at the fyre, & vnleuended bred, and shal eate it with sowre sawse.
{12:9} Ye shal not eate it rawe, ner sodden with water, but onely rosted at the fyre, his heade wt his fete and pertenaunce.
{12:10} And ye shal leaue nothynge of it ouer vntyll the mornynge: but yf eny thinge be left ouer vntyll the mornynge, ye shal burne it with fyre.
{12:11} Of this maner shal ye eate it: Ye shal be gyrded aboute youre loynes, and haue youre shues vpon youre fete, and staues in yor handes, and ye shal eate it with haist: for it is ye LORDES Passeouer.
{12:12} For in the same night wil I go thorow the londe of Egipte, & smyte all the firstborne in the lande of Egipte, from men vnto catell, & vpon all the goddes of Egipte wyll I do execucion.
{12:13} Euen I the LORDE. And the bloude shal be youre token, vpon the houses wherin ye are: yt whan I se the bloude, I maye passe ouer, and that the plage happen not vnto you, to destroye you, whan I smyte the londe of Egipte.
{12:14} And this daye shall ye haue for a remembraunce, and ye shall kepe it holy for a feast vnto the LORDE, ye & all youre posterities, for a perpetuall custome.
{12:15} Seuen dayes shall ye eate vnleuended bred: namely, vpon the first daie shal ye leaue of with leuended bred in youre houses. Who so euer eateth leuended bred from the first daye vnto ye seuenth that soule shall be roted out from Israel.
{12:16} The first daye shall be called holy amonge you, and the seuenth also. No maner of worke shall ye do therin, saue what belongeth to the meate for all maner of soules, that onely maye ye do for you.
{12:17} And kepe you to leuended bred. For euen vpon that same daye wil I brynge youre armies out of the londe of Egipte, therfore shall ye and all youre posterities kepe this daye for a perpetuall custome.
{12:18} Vpon the fourtene daye of the first moneth, at euen, shall ye eate vnleuended bred, vnto the one and twentye daye of the moneth, at euen:
{12:19} so that there be no leuended bred founde in youre houses seuen dayes. For who so euer eateth leuended bred, that soule shall be roted out from the congregacion of Israel, whether it be a straunger or borne in the londe.
{12:20} Therfore eate no leuended bred, but onely vnleuended bred in all youre dwellynges.
{12:21} And Moses called all the Elders of Israel, and sayde vnto them: Chose out, and take to euery housholde a shepe, and kyll Passeouer vnto the LORDE:
{12:22} and take a bunch of ysope, and dyppe it in the bloude in the basen, and stryke it vpon the vpperposte and vpon the two syde postes, and none of you go out at the dore of his house vntyll ye mornynge,
{12:23} for the LORDE wyll go aboute and plage the Egipcians. And whan he seyth the bloude vpo the vpperposte, and vpon the two syde postes, he wyl passe ouer by the dore, and not suffre the destroyer to come in to youre houses to plage.
{12:24} Therfore kepe this custome for the and thy children for euer.
{12:25} And whan ye be come into ye londe that the LORDE shal geue you, (as he hath sayde) then kepe this seruyce.
{12:26} And whan youre children saye vnto you: What seruyce is this, that ye haue?
{12:27} Ye shal saye: It is the sacrifice of the LORDES Passeouer, which passed ouer by the children of Israel in Egipte, whan he plaged the Egipcians, and saued oure houses. Then the people bowed them selues, and worshipped.
{12:28} And the children of Israel wente and dyd, as the LORDE had commaunded Moses and Aaron.
{12:29} And at mydnight the LORDE smote all the firstborne in the lande of Egipte: from Pharaos first sonne (which sat vpon his seate) vntyll the first sonne of the presoner that was in the preson, and all the firstborne of the catell.
{12:30} Then Pharao arose ye same night, and all his seruauntes, and all the Egipcians, & there was a greate crye in Egipte: for there was no house wherin there was not one deed.
{12:31} And he called for Moses and Aaron in ye night, and sayde: Get you vp, and departe out fro my people, ye and the children of Israel: go youre waye, and serue the LORDE, as ye haue sayde:
{12:32} and take youre shepe and youre oxen with you, as ye haue sayde, and departe, and blesse me also.
{12:33} And the Egipcians were fearce vpon the people, to dryue them haistely out of the londe, for they saide: we are all but deed.
{12:34} And the people toke the rawe dowe, before it was leuended (for their foode) bounde in their clothes vpon their shulders.
{12:35} And the children of Israel had done as Moses sayde, and borowed Iewels of syluer and golde, and clothes of the Egipcians:
{12:36} the LORDE also had geuen the people fauoure in the sight of the Egipcians, that they lent them, and so they spoyled the Egipcians.
{12:37} Thus ye children of Israel toke their iourney from Raemses to Suchoth, sixe hundreth thousande men of fote, besyde childre.
{12:38} There wente with them also moch como people, and shepe, and oxen, and exceadinge many catell.
{12:39} And of the rawe dowe that they brought out of Egipte, they baked vnleueded cakes: for it was not leuended, in so moch as they were thrust out of Egipte, and coude not tary: nether had they prepared them eny other meate.
{12:40} The tyme yt the children of Israel dwelt in Egipte, is foure hondreth and thirtie yeares.
{12:41} Whan the same were ended, the whole hoost of the LORDE wente out of the londe of Egipte in one daye.
{12:42} Therfore shall this night be kepte vnto the LORDE, because he brought them out of the londe of Egipte: And the children of Israel shall kepe it vnto the LORDE, they and their posterities.
{12:43} And the LORDE sayde vnto Moses and Aaron: This is the maner of the kepynge of Passeouer. There shal no strauger eate of it.
{12:44} But who so is a bought seruaunt let him be circumcysed, & then eate therof.
{12:45} A straunger and an hyred seruaut shal not eate of it.
{12:46} In one house shal it be eate. Ye shal cary none of his flesh out of the house, and ye shal not breake a bone of him.
{12:47} The whole congregacion of Israel shal do it.
{12:48} But yf there dwel a straunger with the, & wil holde passeouer vnto the LORDE, let him cicumcyse euery one that is male, and then let him first come, and do it, and be as one that is borne in the londe: for there shal no vncircumcysed eate therof.
{12:49} One maner of lawe be vnto him yt is borne in the londe, & vnto the strauger yt dwelleth amoge you.
{12:50} And all the childre of Israel dyd as the LORDE commaunded Moses & Aaron.
{12:51} So vpo one daye the LORDE brought the childre of Israel out of the lode of Egipte with their armyes.
{13:1} And the LORDE spake vnto Moses, & saide:
{13:2} Sanctifie vnto me euery firstborne, yt breaketh all maner of Matrices amonge the childre of Israel, both of men & catell: for they are myne.
{13:3} Then saide Moses vnto ye people: Thinke vpo this daye, in the which ye are gone out of Egipte from the house of bodage, how yt ye LORDE brought you out fro thence wt a mightie hade. Therfore shall ye eate no sowre dowe.
{13:4} This daye are ye gone out, eue in ye moneth of Abib.
{13:5} Now wha ye LORDE hath brought ye in to ye lande of ye Cananites, Hethites, Amorites, Heuites & Iebusites, which he sware vnto yi fathers to geue ye (euen a londe that floweth wt mylke & hony) then shalt thou kepe this seruyce in this moneth.
{13:6} Seue dayes shall thou eate vnleuended bred, & vpon the seuenth daye is the LORDES feast:
{13:7} therfore shalt thou eate vnleuended bred seue dayes, that there be no sowre dowe, ner sowred bred sene in all thy quarters.
{13:8} And thou shalt tell thy sonne at the same tyme, & saye: Because of that, which ye LORDE dyd for me, whan I departed out of Egipte.
{13:9} Therfore shalt it be a signe vnto ye in thine hande, and a token of remembraunce before thine eyes, that the lawe of ye LORDE maye be in thy mouth, how that ye LORDE brought the out of Egipte with a mightie hande:
{13:10} Therfore kepe this maner yearly in his tyme.
{13:11} Whan the LORDE now hath brought ye in to ye lande of the Cananites (as he hath sworne vnto the and thy fathers) and hath geuen it the,
{13:12} then shalt thou sunder out vnto the LORDE all that breaketh the Matrice, and firstborne amonge thy catell, soch as is male.
{13:13} The firstborne of the Asse shalt thou bye out with a shepe: but yf thou redeme it not, then breake his neck. All the firstborne of men amonge thy children shalt thou redeme.
{13:14} And whan thy childe axeth the to daie or tomorow: What is this? Thou shalt saye vnto him: The LORDE brought vs out of Egipte from the house of bondage wt a mightie hande:
{13:15} for whan Pharao was loth to let vs go, the LORDE slew all the firstborne in the lande of Egipte, from the firstborne of men vnto ye firstborne of the catell: therfore offer I vnto the LORDE all that breaketh ye Matrice, beynge a male, and ye firstborne of my children I redeme.
{13:16} And this shal be a signe vnto the in thine hande, and a token to thinke vpon before thine eyes, how that the LORDE brought vs out of Egipte with a mightie hande.
{13:17} Now whan Pharao had let ye people go, God led them not the waye thorow the lode of the Philistynes, which was ye nexte: for he thoughte: The people might repet, wha they se warre, and so turne in agayne into Egipte.
{13:18} Therfore led he the people aboute, euen the waye thorow the wyldernes by ye reed see. And the childre of Israel wente harnessed out of the londe of Egipte.
{13:19} And Moses toke Iosephs bones with him, for he toke an ooth of the children of Israel, and sayde: God wyll surely vyset you, therfore cary awaye my bones with you from hence.
{13:20} So they toke their iourney fro Suchoth, & pitched their tetes in Etha in ye edge of the wildernes.
{13:21} And ye LORDE wete before the by daye in a piler of a cloude, to lede the ye right waye: and by night in a piler of fyre, that he might shewe the light to walke both by daie and night.
{13:22} The piler of the cloude departed neuer from the people by daye, and the pyler of fyre departed not from the by night.
{14:1} And the LORDE spake vnto Moses, and sayde:
{14:2} Speake vnto the children of Israel, and byd them that they turne aboute, & pitch their tentes before the valley of Hyroth, betwixte Migdol & the see towarde Baal Zepho, and there pitch ye tentes right ouer by the see.
{14:3} For Pharao shall saye of the children of Israel: They can not tell how to get out of the londe, the wyldernesse hath shut them in.
{14:4} And I wyll harden his hert, yt he shal folowe after them, & I wil get me honoure vpon Pharao, and vpon all his power. And ye Egipcias shal knowe, yt I am the LORDE. And they dyd so.
{14:5} And whan it was tolde ye kinge of Egipte, yt ye people fled, his hert & his seruauntes were turned agaynst ye people, & saide: Why haue we done this, that we haue let Israel go, yt they shulde not serue vs?
{14:6} And he bounde his charettes fast, and toke his people wt him,
{14:7} and toke sixe hudreth chosen charettes, and the other charettes besyde that were in Egipte, and the captaynes ouer all his:
{14:8} for the LORDE hardened ye hert of Pharao kynge of Egipte, that he folowed after the children of Israel. And the children of Israel wente out with an hye hande.
{14:9} And the Egipcians folowed after the, & ouertoke them (where they had pitched by ye see) with horses and charettes, and horsme, and with his power, in the valley of Hyrath towarde Baal Zephon.
{14:10} And whan Pharao came nye them, the children of Israel lift vp their eyes, and beholde, ye Egipcians wente behinde the, and they were sore afrayed, and cried vnto the LORDE.
{14:11} And sayde vnto Moses: Were there no graues in Egipte, yt thou hast brought vs awaye to dye in the wyldernes? Wherfore hast thou done this vnto vs, that thou hast caried vs out of Egipte?
{14:12} Is not this it, that we sayde vnto the in Egipte? Leaue of, & let vs serue the Egipcians: for it were better for vs to serue the Egipcians, then to dye in the wyldernes?
{14:13} Moses sayde vnto the people: Feare you not, stonde styll, and beholde, what a saluacion the LORDE shall shewe vpon you this daye: for these Egipcians whom ye se this daye, shall ye neuer se more for euer:
{14:14} the LORDE shal fight for you, onely quyete youre selues.
{14:15} The LORDE sayde vnto Moses: Wherfore criest thou vnto me? Speake vnto ye children of Israel, yt they go forwarde.
{14:16} But lift thou vp yi staff, & stretch out thine hade ouer ye see, & parte it asunder, yt the children of Israel maye go in thorow ye middest of it vpon the drye grounde.
{14:17} Beholde, I wyll harden ye hert of the Egipcians, yt they shall folowe after you. Thus wyl I get me honoure vpon Pharao, & vpon all his power, vpo his charettes and horsmen:
{14:18} and the Egipcians shal knowe, that I am ye LORDE, whan I haue gotten me honor vpon Pharao, vpon his charettes, and vpon his horsmen.
{14:19} Then the angell of God yt wente before the armies of Israel, remoued, and gat him behynde them: and the cloudy piler remoued also from before them, and stode behinde the
{14:20} and came betwixte the armies of the Egipcians and the armies of Israel. It was a darcke cloude, and gaue light that night, so that all the night longe these and they coude not come together.
{14:21} Wha Moses now stretched forth his hade ouer ye see, the LORDE caused it to passe awaye thorow a mightie eastwynde all that night, and made the see drye, and ye water deuyded it self a sunder.
{14:22} And the children of Israel wente in thorow the middest of ye see vpon the drye grounde: and ye water was vnto them as a wall, vpon their right hande & vpo their lefte.
{14:23} And ye Egipcias folowed, & wente in after the, all Pharaos horses, & charettes, & horsme, eue in to ye middest of ye see.
{14:24} Now whan the mornynge watch came, the LORDE loked vpo the armies of the Egipcians out the piler of fire and ye cloude, & troubled their armies,
{14:25} and smote the wheles from their charettes, & ouerthrew them wt a storme. Then sayde the Egipcians: Let vs flye from Israel, the LORDE fighteth for the agaynst the Egipcians.
{14:26} But ye LORDE saide vnto Moses: Stretch out thyne hande ouer the see, that ye water maye come agayne vpon the Egipcians, vpon their charettes, and horsmen.
{14:27} Then Moses stretched out his hande ouer the see, and the see came agayne before daye in his course and strength, and the Egipcians fled agaynst it. Thus the LORDE ouerthrew them in the myddest of the see,
{14:28} so that the water came agayne, and couered ye charettes and horsmen, and all Pharaos power which folowed after them in to the see, so that there remayned not one of them.
{14:29} But the children of Israel wente drye thorow ye myddest of the see, and the water was vnto them as a wall vpon their right hande and vpon their lefte.
{14:30} Thus the LORDE delyuered Israel in yt daye from the hande of the Egipcians. And they sawe the Egipcians deed vpon ye see syde,
{14:31} and the greate hande yt the LORDE had shewed vpon the Egipcians. And ye people feared ye LORDE, and beleued him, and his seruaunt Moses.
{15:1} Then sange Moses and the childre of Israel this songe vnto the LORDE, and sayde: I will synge vnto ye LORDE, for he hath done gloriously, horse & charet hath he ouerthrowne in the see.
{15:2} The LORDE is my strength, and my songe, and is become my saluacion. This is my God, I wil magnifie him: He is my fathers God, I wil exalte him.
{15:3} The LORDE is the right man of warre, LORDE is his name.
{15:4} The charettes of Pharao & his power, hath he cast in to the see. His chosen captaynes are drowned in the reed see,
{15:5} ye depe hath couered them: they fell to the grounde as a stone.
{15:6} Thy right hande (O LORDE) is glorious in power: thy right hade (O LORDE) hath smytten the enemies.
{15:7} And with thy greate glory thou hast destroyed thine aduersaries: thou sentest out yi wrath, & it cosumed them, euen as stobble.
{15:8} In the breth of thy wrath the waters fell together, the floudes wente vpon a heape: The depes plomped together in ye myddest of the see.
{15:9} The enemie thought: I will folowe vpon them, and ouertake them, and deuyde ye spoyle, and coole my mynde vpon them. I wil drawe out my swerde, and my hande shal destroye them.
{15:10} Thou blewest with thy wynde, the see couered them, and they sancke downe as leed in the mightie waters.
{15:11} LORDE, who is like vnto the amonge ye goddes? Who is so glorious in holynes, fearfull, laudable, and doinge wonders?
{15:12} When thou stretchedest out yi right hande, the earth swalowed them vp.
{15:13} Thou of yi very mercy hast led this people, whom thou hast delyuered, and with yi strength thou hast brought them vnto the dwellynge of thy Sanctuary.
{15:14} Whan ye nacions herde this, they raged, sorowe came vpon the Philistynes.
{15:15} Then were ye prynces of Edom afrayed, tremblynge came vpo ye mightie of Moab, all the indwellers of Canaan waxed faynte harted.
{15:16} Let feare and drede fall vpon them thorow thy greate arme, that they maye be as styll as a stone, tyll thy people (O LORDE) be gone thorow, tyll yi people whom thou hast gotten, be gone thorow.
{15:17} Brynge them in, and plante them vpon the mountayne of thy enheritaunce, vnto ye place that thou hast made for thyne owne dwellynge: euen to yi teple (O LORDE) which thy handes haue prepared.
{15:18} The LORDE shal be kynge for euer & euer.
{15:19} For Pharao wente in to the see with horses, and charettes, and horsmen, and the LORDE made the see fall agayne vpon them. But the children of Israel wete drye thorow the myddest of the see.
{15:20} And Miriam the prophetisse, Aarons sister, toke a tymbrell in hir hande, and all the women folowed out after her with timbrels in a daunse.
{15:21} And Miriam sange before the: O let vs synge vnto the LORDE, for he hath done gloriously, man and horse hath he ouerthrowne in the see.
{15:22} Moses caused the children of Israel to departe out from the reed see, vnto the wyldernes of Sur, & they wente thre dayes in ye wildernes, yt they founde no water.
{15:23} Then came they to Marath, but they coude not drinke ye water for bytternes, for it was very bytter. Therfore was it called Marah, (yt is bytternes.)
{15:24} Then ye people murmured against Moses, & sayde: What shal we drynke?
{15:25} And Moses cried vnto ye LORDE, which shewed him a tre: this he put in ye water, the was it swete. There he made the a statute, and a lawe, and tempted them,
{15:26} and sayde: Yf thou wylt herken vnto the voyce of ye LORDE yi God, & do that which is right in his sighte, and geue eare vnto his commaundementes, & kepe all his statutes, then wyl I laye vpon ye none of the sicknesses, that I layed vpon Egipte, for I am the LORDE thy surgione.
{15:27} And they came vnto Elim, where there were twolue welles of water, and seuentie palme trees, and there they pitched by ye water syde.
{16:1} From Elim they toke their iourney, and the whole congregacion of the children of Israel came in to the wyldernesse of Sin (which lyeth betwene Elim and Sinai) vpon the fyftene daye of the seconde moneth, after that they were departed out of the londe of Egipte.
{16:2} And ye whole multitude of the children of Israel murmured agaynst Moses and Aaron in ye wildernes,
{16:3} and saide vnto them: Wolde God we had dyed in the londe of Egipte by the hande of the LORDE, whan we sat by ye flesh pottes, and had bred ynough to eate: for ye haue brought vs out in to this wyldernes, to cause this whole multitude dye of honger.
{16:4} The sayde ye LORDE vnto Moses: beholde I wyl rayne you bred from heauen, and let the people go out, and gather daylie, what they nede, that I maye proue whether they walke in my lawe or not.
{16:5} But vpon the sixte daye they shal prepare the selues, that they maye brynge in twyse as moch as they gather daylie.
{16:6} Moses and Aaron saide vnto all the children of Israel: At euen ye shall knowe, that the LORDE hath brought you out of the lode of Egipte,
{16:7} and in the mornynge shall ye se the glory of the LORDE: for he hath herde youre grudginges agaynst the LORDE. For what are we, that ye grudge agaynst vs?
{16:8} Moses sayde morouer: At euen shall the LORDE geue you flesh to eate, and in the mornynge bred ynough: because ye LORDE hath herde youre grudginges, that ye haue grudged agaynst him. For what are we? Youre murmuringe is not agaynst vs, but against the LORDE.
{16:9} And Moses sayde vnto Aaron: Speake vnto the whole multitude of ye children of Israel: Come forth before the LORDE, for he hath herde youre murmuringes.
{16:10} And whyle Aaron spake thus vnto the whole congegacion of the childre of Israel, they turned them towarde the wyldernes: and beholde, the glory of the LORDE appeared in a cloude,
{16:11} and the LORDE sayde vnto Moses:
{16:12} I haue herde the murmuringe of ye children of Israel. Tell them: At euen shall ye haue flesh to eate, and in the mornynge shal ye be fylled with bred, & ye shall knowe, that I am the LORDE youre God.
{16:13} And at euen the quayles came vp, and couered the tentes: and in the mornynge the dewe laye rounde aboute the tentes.
{16:14} And whan the dew was falle, beholde, there laye a thinge in the wildernes, thynne and small, as the horefrost vpon the grounde.
{16:15} And whan the children of Israel sawe it, they saide one to another: This is Ma. For they wyst not what it was. But Moses sayde vnto them: It is the bred that ye LORDE hath geue you to eate.
{16:16} This is it that ye LORDE hath commauded: Euery one gather for himself as moch as he eateth, and take a Gomor for euery heade, acordinge to the nombre of the soules in his tente.
{16:17} And the children of Israel dyd so, and gathered some more, some lesse.
{16:18} But whan it was measured out with ye Gomor, he that gathered moch, had not the more: and he yt gathered litle, wanted nothinge, but euery one gathered for himself, as moch as he ate.
{16:19} And Moses sayde vnto them: Let no ma leaue ought therof vntyll the mornynge.
{16:20} But they harkened not vnto Moses. And some left of it vntill the morninge. Then waxed it full of wormes and stanke. And Moses was angrie at them.
{16:21} And euery mornynge they gathered for them selues, as moch as euery one ate: but as soone as it was whote of the Sonne, it melted awaye.
{16:22} And vpon the sixte daye they gathered twyse as moch of bred, two Gomors for one. And all the rulers of the congregacio came in, and tolde Moses.
{16:23} And he sayde vnto them: This is it, that the LORDE hath sayde: Tomorow is the Sabbath of the holy rest of the LORDE: loke what ye wil bake, that bake: and what ye wyll seeth, that seeth and that remayneth ouer, let it remayne, yt it maye be kepte vntyll the morynynge.
{16:24} And they let it remayne tyll the morow, as Moses commaunded. Then stanke it not, nether was there eny worme therin.
{16:25} The sayde Moses: Eate that to daye, for to daye is ye Sabbath of the LORDE, to daye shal ye fynde none in the felde.
{16:26} Sixe dayes shall ye gather it, but the seuenth daye is the Sabbath, wherin there shal be none.
{16:27} But vpon the seuenth daye there wente out some of the people to gather, and founde nothinge.
{16:28} Then sayde ye LORDE vnto Moses: How longe refuse ye to kepe my commaundementes and lawes?
{16:29} Beholde, ye LORDE hath geuen you the Sabbath, therfore vpon the sixte daye he geueth you bred for two dayes: therfore let euery man now byde at home, and noman go forth of his place vpon the seuenth daye.
{16:30} So the people rested vpo ye seuenth daye.
{16:31} And the house of Israel called it Man, and it was like Coriander sede, and whyte, & had a taist like symnels with hony.
{16:32} And Moses sayde: This is it that ye LORDE hath commaunded: Fill a Gomor therof to be kepte for youre posterities, yt they maye se the bred, wherwith I fed you, whan I brought you out of ye lande of Egipte.
{16:33} And Moses sayde vnto Aaron: Take a cruse, and put a Gomor full of Man therin, and laye it vp before the LORDE, to be kepte for youre posterities,
{16:34} as the LORDE commaunded Moses. So Aaron layed it vp there for a testimony to be kepte.
{16:35} And the children of Israel ate man fourtye yeares, tyll they came vnto a lande, where people dwelt: euen vntyll they came to ye borders of the lande of Canaan ate they Man.
{16:36} A Gomor is the tenth parte of an Epha.
{17:1} And the whole multitude of the children of Israel wete on their iourneys out of the wyldernes of Sin (as the LORDE comaunded the) & pitched in Raphidim. Then had the people no water to drynke.
{17:2} And they chode wt Moses, & sayde: Geue vs water, yt we maye drynke. Moses sayde vnto the: Why chyde ye wt me? Wherfore tepte ye ye LORDE?
{17:3} But whan the people thyrsted there for water, they murmured agaynst Moses, & sayde: Wherfore hast thou caused vs to come out of Egipte? to let vs, oure children, and oure catell dye of honger?
{17:4} Moses cried vnto the LORDE, and sayde: What shal I do wt this people? They are allmost ready to stone me.
{17:5} The LORDE saide vnto him: Go before the people, & take some of the elders of Israel with ye, and take in thine hande thy staff, wherwith thou smotest the water, and go thy waye:
{17:6} Beholde, I wyl stonde there before the vpon a rock in Horeb, there shalt thou smyte the rocke, so shall there water runne out, that the people maye drynke. Moses dyd so before the elders of Israel.
{17:7} Then was that place called Massa Meriba, because of the chydinge of the children of Israel, and because they tempted ye LORDE, and sayde: Is the LORDE amonge vs, or not?
{17:8} Then came Ameleck, & fought agaynst Israel in Raphidim.
{17:9} And Moses sayde vnto Iosua: Chose vs out men, go out, & fight against Amaleck, tomorow wil I stode vpo the toppe of the hyll, & haue ye staff of God in my hande.
{17:10} And Iosua dyd as Moses bade him, & fought agaynst Amalek. Moses & Aaron & Hur wente vp to ye toppe of the hyll.
{17:11} And wha Moses helde vp his hade, Israel had the victory: but whan he let downe his hande, Amalek had the victory.
{17:12} But Moses hades were heuy, therfore toke they a stone, & layed it vnder him, that he might syt vpon it. And Aaron & Hur stayed vp his hades, the one vpon the one syde, and the other vpon ye other syde. So his handes were stedfast vnto ye Sonne wente downe.
{17:13} And Iosua discomfited Amalek, & his people thorow the edge of the swerde.
{17:14} And ye LORDE sayde vnto Moses: Wryte this for a remebraunce in a boke, & comytte it vnto ye eares of Iosua: for I wyll rote out Amalek from vnder heauen, so that he shall nomore be remembred.
{17:15} And Moses buylded an altare vnto the LORDE, and called it: The LORDE Nissi,
{17:16} for he sayde: The battayll of the LORDE shalbe agaynst Amalek thorow an hande vnder the defence of God from childe to childes childe.
{18:1} And whan Iethro ye prest in Madian Moses father in lawe herde of all yt God had done wt Moses & his people of Israel, how yt the LORDE had brought Israel out of Egipte,
{18:2} he toke Zipora Moses wife, whom he had sent backe,
{18:3} with her two sonnes. The one was called Gerson, for he saide: I am become a straunger in a straunge londe.
{18:4} And the other was called Eliaser, for he sayde: The God of my fathers hath bene my helpe, and hath delyuered me from Pharaos swerde.
{18:5} Now wha Iethro Moses father in lawe, and his sonnes and his wife came vnto him in the wyldernes by the mount of God where he had pitched his tent,
{18:6} he sent worde vnto Moses: I Iethro thy father in lawe am come vnto the, and yi wife and both hir children with her.
{18:7} Then wente Moses forth to mete him, and dyd obeysauce vnto him, and kyssed him. And whan they had saluted ech other, they wente in to the tente.
{18:8} Then Moses tolde his father in lawe all that the LORDE had done vnto Pharao and the Egipcians for Israels sake, and all the trauayle that had happened them by ye waye, and how the LORDE had delyuered them.
{18:9} Iethro reioysed ouer all ye good that the LORDE had done for Israel, yt he had delyuered them from the hade of the Egipcians.
{18:10} And Iethro sayde: Praysed be the LORDE, which hath delyuered you from the hande of the Egipcians and of Pharao, (and) that knoweth how to delyuer his people from the Egipcians hande.
{18:11} Now I knowe, that the LORDE is greater the all goddes, because they dealt proudly wt them.
{18:12} And Iethro toke brentofferynges, and offered vnto God. Then came Aaron and all ye elders of Israel to eate bred with Moses father in lawe before God.
{18:13} On the next morow sat Moses to iudge the people, and the people stode roude aboute Moses from the mornynge vntyll ye euen.
{18:14} But whan his father in lawe sawe all that he dyd with the people, he sayde: What is this, that thou doest with the people? Wherfore syttest thou alone, and all ye people stonde rounde aboute from the morninge vntyll the euen?
{18:15} Moses answered him: The people come to me, & axe councell at God:
{18:16} for whan they haue eny thinge to do, they come vnto me, that I maye iudge betwixte euery one & his neghboure, and shewe them the statutes of God, and his lawes.
{18:17} His father in lawe sayde vnto him: It is not well that thou doest.
{18:18} Thou weeriest thy self, and the people that is with the. This busynesse is to sore for the, thou canst not perfourme it alone.
{18:19} But herken vnto my voyce, I will geue the councell, and God shall be with the. Be thou vnto the people to God warde, and brynge the causes before God,
{18:20} and prouide them with statutes and lawes, that thou mayest shewe the the waie wherin they shulde walke, and the workes that they shulde do.
{18:21} But loke out amonge all the people, for honest men, that feare God, soch as are true, & hate couetousnes: make these rulers ouer them, some ouer thousandes, ouer hundredes, ouer fiftie, and ouer ten,
{18:22} that they maye allwaye iudge the people. But where there is eny greate matter, that they brynge the same vnto the, and iudge the small causes them selues: so shall it be lighter for the, yf they beare the burthen with the.
{18:23} Yf thou shalt do this, then mayest thou endure the thinge that God chargeth the withall, and all this people maie go peaceably vnto their place.
{18:24} Moses herkened vnto the voyce of his father in lawe, and dyd all that he sayde.
{18:25} And he chose honest men out of all Israel, and made them heades ouer the people, some ouer thousandes, ouer hundredes, ouer fiftie, and ouer ten,
{18:26} that they might allwaye iudge the people. As for soch causes as were herde, they brought them vnto Moses, and iudged the small matters them selues.
{18:27} So Moses let his father in lawe departe in to his owne londe.
{19:1} In the thirde moneth after that the children of Israel were gone out of the londe of Egipte, they came the same daye in to the wyldernes of Sinai
{19:2} (for they were departed from Raphidim, and wolde in to the wyldernes of Sinai) and there they pitched in the wyldernes ouer against the mounte.
{19:3} And Moses wente vp vnto God. And the LORDE called vnto him out of the mount, and sayde: Thus shalt thou saye vnto the house of Iacob, and tell the children of Israel:
{19:4} Ye haue sene what I haue done vnto the Egipcians, and how I haue borne you vpon Aegles wynges, & brought you vnto my self.
{19:5} Yf ye wyll harken now vnto my voyce, and kepe my couenaunt, ye shalbe myne owne before all people: for the whole earth is myne:
{19:6} and ye shall be vnto me a presterly kingdome, and an holy people. These are the wordes that thou shalt saye vnto the children of Israel.
{19:7} Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and layed before them all these wordes, that the LORDE had commaunded.
{19:8} And all the people answered together, and sayde: All that the LORDE hath sayde, wyll we do. And Moses tolde the wordes of the people vnto the LORDE agayne.
{19:9} And the LORDE sayde vnto Moses: Beholde, I wyll come vnto the in a thicke cloude, that the people maye heare my wordes, which I speake vnto the, and beleue the for euer. And Moses shewed the wordes of the people vnto the LORDE.
{19:10} The LORDE sayde vnto Moses: Go vnto the people, and sanctifie the to daye and tomorow, yt they maye wash their clothes,
{19:11} and be ready agaynst the thirde daye: for vpon the thirde daye shall the LORDE come downe vpon mount Sinai before all the people.
{19:12} And set markes rounde aboute the people, and saye vnto them: Bewarre, that ye go not vp in to ye mount, ner touch ye border of it. For whosoeuer toucheth ye mout, shal dye ye death.
{19:13} There shal no hade touch it, but he shall either be stoned, or shot thorow: whether it be beest or man, it shal not lyue. Whan the horne bleweth, then shal they come vp vnto the mounte.
{19:14} Moses wente downe from the mount vnto the people, and sanctified them. And they wasshed their clothes.
{19:15} And he sayde vnto them: Be ready agaynst the thirde daye, and no man come at his wife.
{19:16} Now whan the thirde daye came (and it was early) it beganne to thonder and lighten, and there was a thicke cloude vpon the mount, and a noyse of a trompet exceadinge mightie. And the people that were in the tentes, were afrayde.
{19:17} And Moses brought the people out of the tentes to mete wt God, and they stode vnder the mount.
{19:18} But all mount Sinai smoked, because ye LORDE came downe vpo it with fyre. And the smoke therof wente vp as the smoke of a fornace, so that the whole mount was exceadinge terrible.
{19:19} And the noyse of the trompet wete out, and was mightie. Moses spake, & God answered him loude.
{19:20} Now whan the LORDE was come downe vpon mount Sinai, euen vpon the toppe of it, he called Moses vp vnto ye toppe of the mount. And Moses wente vp.
{19:21} Then sayde the LORDE vnto him: Go downe, and charge the people, yt they preasse not vnto the LORDE to se him, and so many of them perishe.
{19:22} The rulers also that come nye vnto ye LORDE, shal sanctifie themselues, lest the LORDE smyte the.
{19:23} But Moses sayde vnto the LORDE: The people cannot come vp vpon mount Sinai, for thou hast charged vs, & sayde: Set markes aboute the mount, and sanctifie it.
{19:24} The LORDE sayde vnto him: Go thy waye, get ye downe. Thou and Aaron with the shalt come vp: but the rulers and ye people shal not preasse to come vp vnto ye LORDE, lest he smyte the.
{19:25} And Moses wente downe to the people, and tolde them.
{20:1} And the LORDE spake all these wordes, and sayde:
{20:2} I am the LORDE thy God, which haue brought the out of the londe of Egipte from ye house of bondage.
{20:3} Thou shalt haue none other Goddes in my sight.
{20:4} Thou shalt make the no grauen ymage ner eny symilitude, nether of it that is aboue in heauen, ner of it that is beneth vpon earth, ner of it that is in the water vnder the earth.
{20:5} Worshipe them not, and serue them not: for I the LORDE thy God am a gelouse God, vysitinge ye synne of the fathers vpon the children, vnto ye thirde and fourth generacion, of them that hate me:
{20:6} And do mercye vpo many thousandes, that loue me, and kepe my commaundementes.
{20:7} Thou shalt not take the name of ye LORDE thy God in vayne. For the LORDE shal not holde him vngiltie, that taketh his name in vayne.
{20:8} Remembre the Sabbath daie, that thou sanctifie it.
{20:9} Sixe dayes shalt thou laboure and do all thy worke:
{20:10} But vpon the seuenth daye is the Sabbath of the LORDE thy God: thou shalt do no maner worke in it, nether thou, ner thy sonne, ner thy doughter, ner thy seruaunt, ner thy mayde, ner thy catell, ner thy straunger that is within thy gates.
{20:11} For in sixe dayes the LORDE made heauen and earth, and the see, and all that therin is, and rested vpon the seuenth daye: therfore the LORDE blessed the seuenth daye, & halowed it.
{20:12} Honoure thy father and thy mother, that thou mayest lyue longe in the londe, which the LORDE thy God shal geue the.
{20:13} Thou shalt not kyll.
{20:14} Thou shalt not breake wedlocke.
{20:15} Thou shalt not steale.
{20:16} Thou shalt beare no false wytnesse agaynst thy neghboure.
{20:17} Thou shalt not lust after yi neghbours house. Thou shalt not lust after thy neghbours wife, ner his seruaut, ner his mayde, ner his oxe, ner his Asse, ner all that thy neghboure hath
{20:18} And all the people sawe the thonder and the lightenynge, and the noyse of the trompet, and how that the mountayne smoked, and were afrayed, and stackerd, & stode afarre of,
{20:19} and sayde vnto Moses: Talke thou with vs, we wil heare: and let not God talke with vs, we might els dye.
{20:20} And Moses sayde vnto the people: Be not afrayed, for God is come to proue you, and that his feare maye be before youre eyes, yt ye synne not.
{20:21} And the people stode afarre of. But Moses gat him in to the darcke cloude, where in God was.
{20:22} And the LORDE spake vnto him: Thus shalt thou saye vnto the children of Israel: Ye haue sene, that I haue talked wt you from heauen:
{20:23} therfore shal ye make nothinge with me: goddes of syluer and golde shal ye not make you.
{20:24} Make me an altare of earth, wher vpon thou mayest offer yi burntofferynges, & peaceofferynges, thy shepe and thine oxen. For loke in what place so euer I make ye remembraunce of my name, there wil I come vnto the, and blesse the.
{20:25} And yf thou wilt make me an altare of stone, thou shalt not make it of hewen stone: For yf thou lift vp thy tole vpon it, thou shalt vnhalowe it.
{20:26} Morouer thou shalt not go vp vpon steppes vnto myne altare, that thy shame be not discouered before it.
{21:1} These are the lawes, that thou shalt laye before them.
{21:2} Yf thou bye a seruaunt that is an Hebrue, he shal serue the sixe yeares, in the seuenth yeare shall he go out fre and lowse.
{21:3} Yf he came alone, then shal he go out alone also: but yf he came maried, then shall his wife go out with him.
{21:4} Yf his master haue geue him a wife, & she haue borne him sonnes or doughters, the shal the wife and ye children be the masters, but he shall go out alone.
{21:5} Neuertheles yf the seruaunt saye: I loue my master, and my wife and children, I wil not go out fre:
{21:6} then let his master brynge him before the Goddes, and holde him to the dore or post, and bore him thorow the eare with a botkin, and let him be his seruaunt for euer.
{21:7} Yf a man sell his doughter to be an handmayde, then shal she not go out as the menseruauntes.
{21:8} But yf she please not hir master, and he haue not maried her, then shal he let her go fre: but to sell her vnto a strauge people he hath no auctorite, for so moch as he hath despysed her.
{21:9} Yf he promyse her vnto his sonne, then shal he do vnto her after the lawe of doughters.
{21:10} But yf he geue him another wife, then shall he mynishe nothinge of hir foode, rayment, and dewtye of mariage.
{21:11} Yf he do not these thre, then shal she go out fre, and paye nothinge.
{21:12} He that smyteth a man that he dye, shall dye the death.
{21:13} Yf he haue not layed wayte for him, but God let him fall in his hande vnawares, then wil I appoynte the a place, where he shal flye vnto.
{21:14} But yf a man presume vpon his neghboure, and slaye him with disceate, then shalt thou take the same fro myne altare, that he maye be slayne.
{21:15} Who so smyteth his father or mother, shall dye the death.
{21:16} He that stealeth a man, and selleth him, so that he be founde by him, the same shall dye the death.
{21:17} Who so curseth father and mother, shal dye the death.
{21:18} Yf men stryue together and one smyte another with a stone, or with his fist, so that he dye not, but lyeth in bedd:
{21:19} Yf he ryse, and go forth vpon his staff, the shall he that smote him, be vngiltie: saue that he shal paye the losse of his tyme, and geue ye money for healynge him.
{21:20} He that smyteth his seruaunt or mayde with a staff, that he dye vnder his handes, the same shall suffre vengeaunce therfore.
{21:21} But yf he endure a daye or two, then shall he suffre no vegeaunce therfore, for it is his money.
{21:22} Yf men stryue, and hytt a woman with childe, so that ye frute departe from her, and no harme happen vnto her, then shall he be punyshed for money, as moch as the womans husbande layeth to his charge, and he shall geue it, acordinge to the appoyntement of the dayes men.
{21:23} But yf there come harme vnto her there thorow, then shal he paye soule for soule,
{21:24} eye for eye, toth for toth, hande for hande, fote for fote,
{21:25} burnynge for burnynge, wounde for wounde, strype for strype.
{21:26} Yf a man smyte his seruaunt or his mayde in the eye, and destroye it, he shal let them go fre and lowse for the eye sake.
{21:27} In like maner yf he smyte out a tothe of his seruaunt or mayde, he shall let them go fre and lowse for the tothes sake.
{21:28} Yf an oxe gorre a man or a woman, that he dye, then shall that oxe be stoned, and his flesh not eaten: so is the master of the oxe vngiltie.
{21:29} But yf the oxe haue bene vsed to push in tymes past, & it hath bene tolde his master, and he hath not kepte him, and besydes that slayeth a man or a woman, then shal ye oxe be stoned, and his master shal dye.
{21:30} But yf there be money set vpon him, then, loke what is put vpon him, that shall he geue, to delyuer his soule.
{21:31} Likewyse shall he be dealte withall, yf he gorre a sonne or a doughter.
{21:32} But yf he gorre a seruaunt or a mayde, then shall he geue their master thirtie syluer Sycles: and the oxe shalbe stoned.
{21:33} Yf a man open a well, or dygge a pytt, and couer it not, and there fall an oxe or Asse therin,
{21:34} then shall the owner of the pytt make it good with money, and restore it vnto his master: but the deed carcase shalbe his owne.
{21:35} Yf one mans oxe gorre another, that he dye, then shall they sell the lyuynge oxe, and deuyde the money, and the deed carcase shal they deuyde also.
{21:36} But yf it be knowne, that the oxe haue bene vsed to gorre afore, then shal he paye his oxe for the other, & the deed carcase shal be his owne.
{22:1} Yf a man steale an oxe or shepe, and slaye it, or sell it, he shall restore fyue oxen for an oxe, and foure shepe for a shepe.
{22:2} Yf a thefe be taken breakinge in, & vpon that be smytten that he dye, then shall not he that smote him, be giltie of his bloude.
{22:3} But yf the sonne be gone vp vpo him, then hath he committed manslaughter, and he shal dye. A thefe shall make restitucion. Yf he haue nothige, the let him be solde for his theft.
{22:4} But yf ye theft be founde by him alyue (from the oxe vnto the Asse or shepe) then shall he restore dubble.
{22:5} Yf a man hurte a felde or vynyarde, so yt he let his catell do harme in another mans felde, the same shall make restitucion euen of the best of his owne felde and vynyarde.
{22:6} Yf a fyre come out, and take holde of ye thornes, so that the sheeues be consumed, or the corne that stondeth yet vpon the felde, he that kyndled the fyre shall make restitucion.
{22:7} Yf a man delyuer his neghboure money or vessels to kepe, and it be stollen from him out of his house: yf the thefe be founde, he shal restore dubble.
{22:8} But yf the thefe be not founde, then shal the good man of the house be brought before the Goddes (and shal sweare) that he hath not put his hande vnto his neghbours good.
{22:9} Yf one accuse another in eny maner of trespace, whether it be for oxe, or Asse, or shepe, or rayment, what so euer it be that is lost: then shall both their causes come before the Goddes: Loke whom the Goddes condempne, the same shal restore dubble vnto his neghboure.
{22:10} Yf a man delyuer vnto his neghboure an Asse, or oxe or shepe, or eny maner of catell to kepe, and it dye, or be hurte, or dryuen awaye that no man se it,
{22:11} then shall there an ooth of the LORDE go betwene them, that he hath not put his hande vnto his neghbours good: and the owner of ye good shal accepte it, so that the other shall not make it good.
{22:12} Yf a thefe steale it from him, then shal he make restitucio vnto the owner therof.
{22:13} But yf it be rauyshed (of beastes) then shal he brynge recorde therof, and not make it good.
{22:14} Yf a man borowe ought of his neghboure, and it be hurte, or dye, so that the owner therof be not by, then shall he make it good.
{22:15} But yf the owner therof be by, then shal he not make it good, yf he hyred it for his money.
{22:16} Yf a man begile a mayde, that is not yet spoused, and lye with her, the same shal geue her hir dowry, and take her to his wife.
{22:17} But yf hir father refuse to geue her vnto him, the shall he weye there the money, acordinge to the dowry of virgins.
{22:18} Thou shalt not suffre a witch to lyue.
{22:19} Who so lyeth wt a beest, shal dye the death.
{22:20} Who so offreth to eny goddes, saue vnto the LORDE onely, let him dye without redempcion.
{22:21} Thou shalt not vexe ner oppresse a straunger, for ye youre selues were straungers also in the londe of Egipte.
{22:22} Ye shall truble no wyddowe ner fatherlesse childe.
{22:23} Yf thou shalt trouble them, they shall crie vnto me, and I shall heare their crye:
{22:24} then shal my wrath waxe whote, so yt I shal sley you with the swerde, and youre wyues shalbe wedowes, and youre children fatherlesse,
{22:25} Yf thou lende money vnto my people that is poore by the, thou shalt not behaue thyself as an vsurer vnto him, nether shalt thou oppresse him with vsury.
{22:26} Yf thou take a garment of thy neghboure to pledge, thou shalt geue it him agayne before the Sonne go downe:
{22:27} for his raymet is his onely couerynge of his skynne: wherin he slepeth. But yf he shall crie vnto me, I wyll heare him: for I am mercifull.
{22:28} Thou shalt not speake euell of the Goddes, and the ruler of thy people shall thou not blaspheme.
{22:29} Thy drie and moist frutes shalt thou not kepe backe. Thy first sonne shalt thou geue vnto me.
{22:30} So shalt thou do also with thine oxen and shepe. Seuen dayes let it be with the dame: Vpon the eight daye shalt thou geue it vnto me.
{22:31} Ye shalbe holy people before me. Therfore shal ye eate no flesh, that is torne of beestes in the felde, but cast it vnto the dogges.
{23:1} Thou shalt not accepte a vayne tale, that thou woldest manteyne the vngodly, and be a false wytnesse.
{23:2} Thou shalt not folowe the multitude vnto euell, ner answere at the lawe that thou woldest (to folowe the multitude) turne a syde from the right.
{23:3} Thou shalt not paynte a poore mas cause.
{23:4} Yf thou mete thine enemies oxe or Asse, goinge astraye, thou shalt brynge the same vnto him agayne.
{23:5} Yf thou se the Asse of him that hateth the, lye vnder his burthen, thou shalt not let him lye, but shalt helpe him vp.
{23:6} Thou shalt not wraist the righte of thy poore in his cause.
{23:7} Kepe the farre from false matters. The innocent and righteous shalt thou not sley, for I iustifie not ye vngodly.
{23:8} Thou shalt not take giftes: for giftes blinde euen them yt are sharpe of sight, & wraist the righteous causes.
{23:9} Ye shall not oppresse a straunger, for ye knowe the hert of straungers, for so moch as ye youre selues also haue bene straungers in the londe of Egipte.
{23:10} Sixe yeares shalt thou sowe thy londe, and gather in the frute therof:
{23:11} In the seuenth yeare shalt thou let it rest and lye still, that the poore amonge thy people maye eate therof: and loke what remayneth ouer, let ye beestes of the felde eate it. Thus shalt thou do also with thy vynyarde and olyue trees.
{23:12} Sixe dayes shalt thou do thy worke, but vpon the seuenth daye thou shalt kepe holy daye, that thine oxe and Asse maye rest, and that the sonne of thy handmayden and the straunger maye refresh them selues.
{23:13} All that I haue sayde vnto you, that kepe. And as for the names of other goddes, ye shall not remembre them, and out of youre mouthes shal they not be herde.
{23:14} Thre tymes in the yeare
{23:15} shalt thou kepe feast vnto me: namely the feast of vnleuended bred shalt thou kepe, that thou eate vnleuended bred seuen dayes ( like as I commaunded ye) in the tyme of ye moneth Abib, for in the same wentest thou out of Egipte. (But appeare not emptye before me.)
{23:16} And ye feast whan thou first reapest thy labours, yt thou hast sowen vpon the felde. And the feast of ingatherynge in the ende of ye yeare, whan thou hast gathered in thy laboures out of the felde.
{23:17} Thre tymes in the yeare shal euery male that thou hast, appeare before the LORDE the Gouernoure.
{23:18} Thou shalt not offre the bloude of my sacrifice with sowre dowe, and the fat of my feast shal not remayne till the mornynge.
{23:19} The first of the first frutes of thy felde shalt thou brynge in to the house of the LORDE thy God. And shalt not seeth a kydd, whyle it is in his mothers mylke.
{23:20} Beholde, I sende an angell before the, to kepe the in the waye, and to brynge the vnto the place, that I haue prepared.
{23:21} Therfore bewarre of his face, and herken vnto his voyce, and anger him not, for he shall not spare youre mysdedes, & my name is in him.
{23:22} But yf thou shalt herken vnto his voyce, and do all that I shal tell the, then wyl I be enemie vnto thy enemyes, and aduersary vnto thy aduersaries.
{23:23} Now wha myne angell goeth before the, & bryngeth the vnto ye Amorites, Hethites, Pheresites, Cananites, Heuites & Iebusites, & I shall haue destroyed them:
{23:24} then shalt thou not worshipe their goddes, ner serue them, nether shalt thou do as they do, but shalt ouerthrowe their goddes, & breake the downe.
{23:25} But ye LORDE yor God shal ye serue, so shal he blesse thy bred & thy water, and I wyl remoue all sicknesse from the.
{23:26} There shalbe nothinge baren ner vnfrutefull in thy londe, and I wil fulfill the nombre of thy dayes.
{23:27} I wil sende my feare before the, and sley all the people where thou comest, & will make all thine enemies to turne their backes vpo the.
{23:28} I wyll sende hornettes before ye, and dryue out the Heuytes, Cananites and Hethytes before the.
{23:29} In one yeare wyl I not cast the out before the, yt the londe become not waist, & wylde beastes multiply agaynst ye:
{23:30} By litle & litle wyll I dryue them out before the, tyll thou growe, & haue the londe in possession.
{23:31} And I wil set the borders of thy londe, euen from the reed see vnto ye see of the Philistynes, & from the wyldernes vnto the water. For I wil delyuer the indwellers of the londe in to thine hande, yt thou shalt dryue them out before the.
{23:32} Thou shalt make no couenaunt wt them ner with their goddes,
{23:33} but let the not dwell in thy lande, that they make the not synne ageynst me. For yf thou serue their goddes, it wil surely be thy decaye.
{24:1} And he sayde vnto Moses: Come vp vnto the LORDE thou & Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and the seuetie elders of Israel, & worshipe afarre of.
{24:2} But let Moses onely come nye vnto the LORDE, and let not them come nye, and let not the people also come vp with him.
{24:3} Moses came and tolde the people all the wordes of the LORDE, & all the lawes. Then answered all the people with one voyce, and sayde: All ye wordes that the LORDE hath sayde, wyl we do.
{24:4} Then wrote Moses all the wordes of ye LORDE, & gat him vp by tymes in the mornynge, & buylded an altare vnder ye mount with twolue pilers, acordinge to the twolue trybes of Israel:
{24:5} & sent twolue yonge me of the children of Israel, to offre burntofferynges, and peace offerynges theron of bullockes vnto the LORDE.
{24:6} And Moses toke the half parte of the bloude, and put it in a basen, the other half sprenkled he vpon the altare:
{24:7} & toke the boke of ye couenaunt, & cried in the eares of the people. And whan they had sayde: All yt the LORDE hath sayde, wil we do, & herken vnto him:
{24:8} Moses toke the bloude, & sprenkled it vpon the people, & sayde: Beholde, this is ye bloude of the couenaunt that the LORDE maketh wt you vpon all these wordes.
{24:9} Then wente Moses & Aaron, Nadab & Abihu, & the seuentye elders of Israel vp,
{24:10} & sawe ye God of Israel. Vnder his fete it was like a stone worke of Saphyre, & as the fashion of heaue, wha it is cleare,
{24:11} & he put not his hade vpo the pryncipall of Israel. And whan they had sene God, they ate & dronke.
{24:12} And the LORDE sayde vnto Moses: Come vp vnto me vpon the mount, & remayne there, yt I maye geue the tables of stone, & ye lawe & commaundemetes yt I haue wrytten, which thou shalt teach the.
{24:13} Then Moses gat him vp & his mynister Iosua, & wente vp into the mount of God,
{24:14} & sayde vnto the elders: Tary ye here, tyll we come to you agayne: beholde, Aaron and Hur are with you, yf eny ma haue a matter to do, let him brynge it vnto them.
{24:15} Now wha Moses came vp in to ye mout, a cloude mount:
{24:16} & the glory of ye LORDE abode vpon mount Sinai, & couered it wt the cloude sixe dayes, & vpon the seueth daye he called Moses out of ye cloude.
{24:17} And ye fashion of ye glory of ye LORDE was like a cosumynge fyre vpon the toppe of ye mount in the sight of the children of Israel.
{24:18} And Moses wente in to the myddest of the cloude, and asceded vp in to the mount, and abode vpon the mount fourtye dayes & fourtye nightes.
{25:1} And ye LORDE talked wt Moses & ayde:
{25:2} Speake vnto ye childre of Israel, yt they geue me an Heue offerynge, & take the some of euery man, that hath a fre wyllynge hert therto.
{25:3} And this is the Heueofferynge that ye shal take of them: Golde, syluer, brasse,
{25:4} yalowe sylke, scarlet, purple, whyte twyned sylke, goates hayre,
{25:5} reed skynnes of rammes, doo skynnes, Fyrre tre,
{25:6} oyle for lampes, spyces for the anoyntynge oyle, and for swete incense.
{25:7} Onix stones and set stones for the ouerbody cote and for the brestlappe.
{25:8} And they shall make me a Sanctuary, that I maie dwell amonge them.
{25:9} Like as I shal shewe ye a patrone of the Habitacion, and of all the ornamentes therof, so shall ye make it.
{25:10} Make an Arke of Fyrre tre two cubytes & a half longe, a cubyte & a half brode, and a cubyte & an half hye:
{25:11} this shalt thou ouerleye with pure golde within and without, & make an hye vpo it a crowne of golde rounde aboute,
{25:12} and cast foure rynges of golde, & put them in the foure corners of it, so that two rynges be vpon the one syde, and two vpon the other syde.
{25:13} And make staues of Fyrre tre, and ouer laye them with golde,
{25:14} and put them in the rynges alonge by the sydes of the Arke, to beare it withall:
{25:15} and they shal abyde styll in the rynges, & not be take out.
{25:16} And in ye Arke thou shalt laye the wytnesse, that I wyl geue the.
{25:17} Thou shalt make a Mercyseate also of pure golde, two cubytes and a half longe, and a cubyte & a half brode.
{25:18} And thou shalt make two Cherubyns of beaten golde vpo both ye endes of the Mercyseate,
{25:19} yt the one Cherub maye be vpon the one ende, & the other vpon the other ende, & so to be two Cherubyns vpon the endes of the Mercyseate.
{25:20} And the Cherubyns shall sprede out their wynges ouer an hye, yt they maye couer ye Mercyseate wt their wynges: & yt either their faces maye be right ouer one agaynst another, and their faces shal loke vnto the Mercyseate.
{25:21} And thou shalt set ye Mercyseate aboue vpon the Arke. And in the Arke thou shalt laye the wytnesse, yt I shal geue the.
{25:22} From yt place wyll I testifie vnto ye, and talke with the, namely, from ye Mercyseate (betwixte the two Cherubyns) which is vpon the Arke of wytnesse, of all that I wyl comaunde ye vnto the children of Israel.
{25:23} Thou shalt make a table also of Fyrre tre, two cubites longe, and one cubyte brode, and a cubyte and a half hye,
{25:24} and ouerlaye it with pure golde, and make a crowne of golde rounde aboute it,
{25:25} and an whope of an hade brede hye, and a crowne of golde vnto ye whope rounde aboute.
{25:26} And vnto it thou shalt make foure rynges of golde, on the foure corners in the foure fete of it:
{25:27} harde vnder the whope shall ye rynges be, to put in staues and to beare the table wt all:
{25:28} and thou shalt make the staues of Fyrre tre, & ouerlaye them with golde, yt the table maye be borne therwith.
{25:29} Thou shalt make also his disshes, spones, pottes, and flat peces of pure golde, to poure out and in.

{27:21} in the Tabernacle of wytnes without the vayle, that hangeth before the wytnesse. And Aaro and his sonnes shal dresse it from the euenynge vntyll ye mornynge before the LORDE. This shalbe vnto you a perpetuall custome for youre posterities amonge the children of Israel.
{28:1} And thou shalt take vnto the Aaron thy brother and his sonnes fro amonge the childre of Israel, that he maye be my prest: namely Aaron & his sonnes Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar:
{28:2} & thou shalt make holy clothes for Aaro yi brother, honorable and glorious,

{28:12} and thou shalt put them vpon the two shulders of the ouerbody cote, that that they maye be stones of remembraunce for the children of Israel, that Aaron maye beare their names vpon both his shulders before the LORDE for a remembraunce.
{28:13} Thou shalt make hokes of golde also,
{28:14} and two wrethe cheynes of pure golde, and shalt fasten them vnto the hokes.
{28:15} The brestlappe of iudgment shalt thou make of broderd worke, euen after the worke of the ouerbody cote: of golde, yalow sylke, scarlet, purple, and whyte twyned sylke.
{28:16} Foure square shall it be and dubble, an hande bredth longe, and an handebredth brode.
{28:17} And thou shalt fill it with foure rowes full of stones. Let the first rowe be a Sardis, a Topas, and a Smaragde.

{28:24} and put the two wrethe cheynes of golde in the same two rynges, that are in two edges of the brestlappe.
{28:25} But the two endes of ye two wrethen cheynes shalt thou fasten in the two hokes vpon the ouerbody cote one ouer agaynst another.
{28:26} And thou shalt make two other rynges of golde, and fasten them vnto ye other two edges of ye brestlappe, namely to ye borders therof, wherwith it maye hange on the ynsyde vpon the ouerbody cote.
{28:27} And yet shalt thou make two rynges of golde, and fasten them vpon the two edges beneth to the ouerbody cote, vpon the outsyde one ouer agaynst anothe, where the ouerbody cote ioyneth together.
{28:28} And the brestlappe shall be fastened by his rynges vnto the rynges of the ouerbody cote with a yalow lace, that it maye lye close vpon the ouerbody cote, and that the brestlappe be not lowsed from the ouerbody cote.
{28:29} Thus shall Aaron beare the names of the children of Israel in ye brestlappe of iudgment vpon his hert, whan he goeth into the Sanctuary, for a remembraunce before the LORDE allwaye.
{28:30} And in the brestlappe of iudgment thou shalt put light and perfectnesse, that they be vpon Aaros hert, whan he goeth in before the LORDE, and that he maye beare the iudgment of the children of Israel vpon his hert before the LORDE allwaye.
{28:31} Thou shalt make the tunykle also to the ouerbody cote all of yalow sylke,
{28:32} and aboue in the myddest there shal be an hole, and a bonde folden together rounde aboute the hole, that it rente not.
{28:33} And beneth vpon the hemme thou shalt make pomgranates of yalow sylke, scarlet, purple rounde aboute,
{28:34} and belles of golde betwixte the same rounde aboute: that there be euer a golden bell and a pomgranate, a golden bell and a pomgranate rounde aboute the hemme of the same tunycle.
{28:35} And Aaron shall haue it vpon him wha he mynistreth, that the soude therof maye be herde, whan he goeth out and in at the Sanctuary before the LORDE, that he dye not.
{28:36} Thou shalt make a foreheade plate also of pure golde, and graue therin (after the workmanshipe of the stone grauer): the holynes of the LORDE,
{28:37} & with a yalow lace shalt thou fasten it vnto the fore front of the myter
{28:38} vpon Aarons fore heade, yt Aaron maie so beare ye synne of the holy thinges, which the childre of Israel halowe in all their giftes and Sanctuary. And it shall be allwaye vpon his fore heade, that he maye reconcyle them before the LORDE.
{28:39} Thou shalt make an albe also of whyte sylke, and a myter of whyte sylke, and a gyrdle of nedle worke.
{28:40} And for Aarons sonnes thou shalt make cotes, gyrdles and bonetes, honorable and glorious,
{28:41} and shalt put them vpon thy brother Aaron and his sonnes, and shalt anoynte them, and fyll their handes, and consecrate them, that they maye be my prestes.
{28:42} And thou shalt make them lynnen breches, to couer the flesh of their prenities, from the loynes vnto the thyes.
{28:43} And Aaron and his sonnes shall haue them on, whan they go in to the Tabernacle of wytnesse, or go vnto the altare to mynister in the Holy, that they beare not their synne, and dye. This shalbe a perpetual custome for him, and his sede after him.
{29:1} This is it also, that thou shalt do vnto them, that they maye be consecrated prestes vnto me. Take a yonge bullocke, and two rammes without blemish,
{29:2} vnleuended bred, & vnleuended cakes myxte wt oyle, and wafers of swete bred tempered wt oyle: Of wheate floure shalt thou make them all,
{29:3} and put them in a maunde, & brynge them in the maunde, with the bullocke & two rammes.
{29:4} And thou shalt brynge Aaron & his sonnes vnto the dore of the Tabernacle of witnesse, & wash them wt water,
{29:5} & take the garmentes, and put vpon Aaron the albe and the tunycle, & the ouer body cote, & the brestlappe to ye ouer body cote, & shalt gyrde him on the out syde vpon the ouer body cote,
{29:6} and set the myter vpon his heade, and the holy crowne vpon the myter:
{29:7} and shalt take the anoyntinge oyle, and poure it vpon his heade, and anoynte him.
{29:8} Thou shalt brynge forth his sonnes also,
{29:9} & put the albes vpon them, and gyrde both Aaron & them with gyrdles, & set the bonettes vpon their heades, that they maye haue the presthode for a perpetuall custome. And thou shalt fyll the hades of Aaron and his sonnes,
{29:10} and brynge forth the bullocke before the Tabernacle of wytnesse. And Aaron and his sonnes shall laye their hades vpon the heade of the bullocke,
{29:11} and thou shalt sley the bullocke before the LORDE, at the dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse,
{29:12} and shalt take of his bloude, and put it vpon the hornes of the altare with thy fynger, and poure all the other bloude vpon the botome of the altare.
{29:13} And thou shalt take all the fat that couereth the bowels and the nett vpon the leuer, and the two kydneys with the fat that is aboute them, and burne them vpon the altare.
{29:14} But the bullockes flesh, skynne and donge, shalt thou burne with fyre without the hoost: for it is a synneofferynge.
{29:15} The one ramme shalt thou take also, and Aaron with his sonnes shall laye their handes vpon his heade.
{29:16} Then shalt thou sleye him, and take of his bloude, and sprenkle it vpon the altare rounde aboute.
{29:17} But the ramme shalt thou deuyde in peces, and wash his bowels and his legges, and laye them vpon the peces and the heade,
{29:18} and burne the whole ramme vpon the altare: for it is a burntofferynge, and a swete sauoure of the sacrifice vnto the LORDE.
{29:19} As for the other ramme, thou shalt take him, and Aaron with his sonnes shall laye their handes vpon his heade,
{29:20} and thou shalt slaye him, and take of his bloude, and put it vpon the typpe of the right eare of Aaron and his sonnes, and vpon ye thombe of their right handes, and vpon the greate too of their right fete, and thou shalt sprenkle the bloude vpon the altare rounde aboute,
{29:21} and shalt take of the bloude vpon the altare and the anoyntinge oyle, and sprenckle it vpon Aaron and his vestymentes, vpon his sonnes and their vestymentes. So shall he and his clothes, his sonnes and their clothes be consecrated.
{29:22} Then shalt thou take the fat of the ramme, the rompe, and the fatt that couereth ye bowels, the net vpon the leuer, and the two kydneys with the fatt that is aboute them, and the right shulder (for it is a ramme of cosecracion)
{29:23} and a symnel of bred, and an oyled cake, and a wafer out of the maunde of the vnleuended bred that stondeth before ye LORDE,
{29:24} and put all in to the handes of Aaron and of his sonnes, and waue it vnto the LORDE.
{29:25} The take it out of their handes, and burne it vpon the altare for a burnt offeringe, to be a swete sauoure vnto ye LORDE. For it is the LORDES sacrifice.
{29:26} And thou shalt take the brest of the ramme of Aaros consecracio, & shalt waue it before ye LORDE, yt shal be his parte.
{29:27} And thus shalt thou halowe ye Wauebrest & ye Heueshulder (yt are waued & heaued) of ye ramme of the consecracion of Aaron & his sonnes:
{29:28} And it shalbe a perpetuall custome for Aaro and his sonnes of ye children of Israel: for it is an Heue offrynge, and the Heue offrynge shalbe the LORDES dewtye of the children of Israel, in their deade offrynges and Heueoffrynges which they do vnto the LORDE.
{29:29} And the holy garmentes of Aaron shall his sonnes haue after him, that they maie be anoynted therin, & yt their handes maye be fylled.
{29:30} Loke which of his sonnes shalbe prest in his steade, the same shal put them on seue dayes, that he maye go in to the Tabernacle of wytnesse, to mynister in the Sanctuary.
{29:31} But the ramme of consecracion shalt thou take, and seeth his flesh in an holy place.
{29:32} And Aaron with his sonnes shal eate the flesh of the same ramme with the bred in the maunde, at the dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse:
{29:33} for there is an attonement made therwith, to fyll their handes, that they maye be consecrated. A strauger shal not eate therof, for it is holy.
{29:34} But yf eny of the flesh of the consecracion, and of the bred remaine vntyll the mornynge, thou shalt burne it with fyre, and not let it be eaten, for it is holy.
{29:35} And thus shalt thou do with Aaron and his sonnes all that I haue commaunded ye. Seuen dayes shalt thou fyll their handes,
{29:36} and offer a bullocke daylie for a synne offeringe, because of them yt shalbe reconciled. And thou shalt halowe the altare, whan thou reconcylest it: & shalt anoynte it, that it maye be consecrated.
{29:37} Seuen dayes shalt thou reconcyle the altare, & consecrate it, that it maye be an altare of the Most holy. Who so wyll touch the altare, must be consecrated.
{29:38} And this shalt thou do with the altare: Two lambes of one yeare olde shalt thou offer euery daye vpon it:
{29:39} the one lambe in the mornynge, and the other at euen.
{29:40} And to one lambe a tenth deale of wheate floure, megled with ye fourth parte of an Hin of beaten oyle, and ye fourth parte of an Hin of wine for a drynk offerynge
{29:41} With the other lambe at euen shalt thou do like as with ye meateofferynge and drynkofferynge in the mornynge, for a swete sauoure of sacrifice vnto ye LORDE.
{29:42} This is the daylie burntofferynge amonge youre posterities, at the dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse before the LORDE, where I will proteste vnto you, and talke with the.
{29:43} There wil I proteste vnto the children of Israel, and be sanctified in my glory,
{29:44} and wyl halowe the Tabernacle of wytnes and the altare, and consecrate Aaro and his sonnes, to be my prestes.
{29:45} And I wyl dwell amonge the children of Israel, & wyll be their God:
{29:46} so yt they shal knowe, how that I am the LORDE their God, which brought them out of the londe of Egipte, that I might dwell amonge them, euen I the LORDE their God.
{30:1} Thou shalt make also an incense altare to burne incense, of Fyrre tre,
{30:2} a cubyte longe & brode, eauen foure squared, and two cubytes hye with his hornes,
{30:3} & shalt ouerlaye it with pure golde, the rofe & the walles of it rounde aboute, and the hornes therof, & a crowne of golde shalt thou make rounde aboute it,
{30:4} and two golde rynges on ether syde vnder the crowne, that there maie be staues put therin, to beare it withall.
{30:5} The staues shalt thou make of Fyrre tre also, and ouerlaye the with golde:
{30:6} and shalt set it before the vayle, that hangeth before the Arke of wytnesse, and before the Mercyseate yt is vpon the wytnesse, from whence I wyl proteste vnto the.
{30:7} And Aaron shal burne swete incense theron euery morninge, wha he dresseth the lampes.
{30:8} In like maner whan he lighteth the lampes at euen, he shall burne soch incense also. This shal be the daylie incense before the LORDE amonge youre posterities.
{30:9} Ye shall put no straunge incense therin, & offer no burntofferynge, ner meatofferynge, nether drynkofferynge theron.
{30:10} And vpon ye hornes of it shall Aaron reconcyle once in a yeare, with ye bloude of the synneofferynge, which they shall offer that are reconcyled. This shal be done amonge youre posterities for this is the most holy vnto the LORDE.
{30:11} And the LORDE spake vnto Moses, and sayde:
{30:12} Whan thou nombrest the heades of the children of Israel, then shal euery one geue vnto the LORDE the reconcylinge of his soule, yt there happe not a plage vnto them, whan they are nombred.
{30:13} Euery one that is tolde in the nombre, shall geue half a Sycle, after the Sycle of the Sanctuary: one Sycle is worth twentye Geras. This half Sycle shal be ye LORDES Heue offerynge.
{30:14} Who so is in the nombre from twenty yeare and aboue, shal geue this Heue offerynge vnto ye LORDE.
{30:15} The riche shal not geue more, and the poore shal not geue lesse in the half Sycle, which is geuen vnto the LORDE to be an Heue offerynge for the reconcylinge of their soules.
{30:16} And this money of recocilinge shalt thou take of the children of Israel, & put it to the Gods seruyce of the Tabernacle of wytnes, that it maye be a remembraunce vnto the children of Israel before the LORDE, that he maye let himself be reconcyled ouer their soules.
{30:17} And the LORDE spake vnto Moses, and sayde:
{30:18} Thou shalt make a brasen lauer also with a fote of brasse to wash, and shalt set it betwixte the Tabernacle of witnesse and ye altare, and put water therin,
{30:19} that Aaro and his sonnes maye wash their handes and fete therout,
{30:20} whan they go in to the Tabernacle of wytnesse, or to the altare, to mynistre vnto the LORDE with offerynge incense, yt they dye not.
{30:21} This shalbe a perpetuall custome for him and his sede amonge their posterities.
{30:22} And ye LORDE spake vnto Moses, and sayde:
{30:23} Take vnto the spyces of the best, fyue hundreth Sycles of Myrre, and of Cynamo half so moch, euen two hundreth and fyftie,
{30:24} and of Kalmus two hundreth and fiftye, and of Cassia fyue hundreth (after the Sycle of the Sanctuary) & an Hin of oyle olyue,
{30:25} and make an holy anoyntinge oyle, after the craft of the Apotecary.
{30:26} And there wt shalt thou anonynte the Tabernacle of wytnesse, & the Arke of wytnes,
{30:27} the table with all his apparell, ye candilsticke with his apparell, the altare of incense,
{30:28} the altare of burntofferynges with all his apparell, & the lauer with his fote:
{30:29} and thus shalt thou consecrate them, that they maye be most holy: for who so wil touch the, must be consecrated.
{30:30} Thou shalt anoynte Aaron also, and his sonnes, and consecrate them to be my prestes.
{30:31} And thou shalt speake vnto the childre of Israel, and saye: This oyle shalbe an holy oyntment vnto me amonge yor posterities:
{30:32} It shal not be poured vpon mans body, nether shalt thou make eny soch like it, for it is holy: therfore shal it be holy vnto you.
{30:33} Who so maketh eny soch like, or geueth a strauger therof, the same shalbe roted out from amonge his people.
{30:34} And the LORDE sayde vnto Moses: Take vnto the spyces: Balme, Stacte, Galban, and pure franckencense, of one as moch as of another,
{30:35} and make incense therof (after the craft of the Apotecary) myngled together, that it maye be pure & holy.
{30:36} And thou shalt beate it to poulder, and shalt put of the same before the wytnesse in the Tabernacle of wytnesse, from whence I wyll proteste vnto the,
{30:37} but it shalbe holy vnto the for the LORDE.
{30:38} Who so maketh soch to cense therwith, shalbe roted out from amoge his people.
{31:1} And the LORDE spake vnto Moses, & saide:
{31:2} I haue called by name Bezaleel the sonne of Vri ye sonne of Hur, of ye trybe of Iuda,
{31:3} and haue fylled him with ye sprete of God, with wysdome and vnderstodynge and knowlege, and to worke
{31:4} with all maner of connynge worke, in golde, syluer, brasse,
{31:5} to graue stones connyngly, and to set them, to carue well in tymbre, and to make all maner worke.
{31:6} And beholde, I haue geuen him Ahaliab the sonne of Ahisamach of the trybe of Dan, to be his companyon, and haue geuen wysdome in to the hertes of all that are wyse, that they shall make all that I haue commaunded the:
{31:7} the Tabernacle of wytnesse, the Arke of wytnesse, the Mercyseate theron, and all the ornamentes of ye Tabernacle:
{31:8} the table and his apparell, the candilsticke and all his apparell, the altare of incense,
{31:9} the altare of burntofferynges wt all his apparell, the lauer with his fote,
{31:10} the mynistrynge vestimentes of Aaron ye prest, and the garmentes of his sonnes to serue like prestes,
{31:11} the anoyntinge oyle, and the incese of spyces for ye Sactuary. All that I haue commaunded the, shal they make.
{31:12} And the LORDE talked vnto Moses, and sayde:
{31:13} Speake vnto the children of Israel, and saye: Kepe my Sabbath, for it is a token betwene me and you, and youre posterities, that ye maye knowe, how that I am the LORDE which haloweth you:
{31:14} therfore kepe my Sabbath, for it shalbe holy vnto you. Who so vnhaloweth it, shall dye the death: For who so doth eny worke therin, shalbe roted out from amonge his people.
{31:15} Sixe dayes shall men worke, but vpon the seuenth daye is the Sabbath the holy rest of the LORDE. Who so doth eny worke vpon the Sabbath daye, shall dye the death.
{31:16} Therfore shal the children of Israel kepe the Sabbath, that they maye kepe it also amonge their posterities for an euerlastynge couenaunt.
{31:17} An euerlastynge token is it betwixte me and the children of Israel. For in sixe dayes made the LORDE heaue & earth, but vpon ye seuenth daye he rested, and was refreshed.
{31:18} And whan the LORDE had made an ende of talkinge with Moses vpon the mount Sinai, he gaue him two tables of witnesse, which were of stone, and wrytten with the fynger of God.
{32:1} But whan the people sawe that Moses made loge taryenge to come downe fro the mount, they gathered the together agaynst Aaron, & sayde vnto him: Vp, and make vs goddes, to go before vs, for we can not tell what is become of this man Moses, that brought vs out of Egipte.
{32:2} Aaron sayde vnto them: Plucke of the golden earynges from the eares of youre wyues, of yor sonnes, & of yor doughters, & brynge them vnto me.
{32:3} Then all the people pluckte of their golden earynges from their eares, & brought them vnto Aaron.
{32:4} And he toke them of their handes, & fashioned it wt a grauer. And they made a molten calfe, and sayde: These are thy goddes (O Israel) that brought the out of the londe of Egipte.
{32:5} Whan Aaron sawe that, he buylded an altare before him, and caused it be proclamed, and sayde: Tomorow is the LORDES feast.
{32:6} And they arose vp early in the mornynge, and offred burntofferynges, and brought deadofferynges also: Then the people sat them downe to eate and drynke, & rose vp to playe.
{32:7} But the LORDE sayde vnto Moses: Go get the downe, for thy people whom thou broughtest out of the londe of Egipte,
{32:8} haue marred all: they are soone gone out of the waie, which I commaunded them. They haue made them a molten calfe, and haue worshipped it, & offred vnto it, & sayde: These are thy goddes (O Israel) that brought the out of the lande of Egipte.
{32:9} And the LORDE sayde vnto Moses: I se, that it is a styffnecked people,
{32:10} and now suffre me, that my wrath maye waxe whote ouer them, & that I maye consume them, so wil I make a greate people of the.
{32:11} But Moses be sought the LORDE his God, & sayde: Oh LORDE, wherfore wil thy wrath waxe whote ouer thy people, whom thou hast brought out of the lode of Egipte wt greate power & a mightie hade?
{32:12} Wherfore shulde the Egipcians speake, & saye: He hath brought the for their myschefe, to slaye them in the mountaynes, and to destroye the vtterly from the earth? O turne the from the fearcenesse of yi wrath, & be gracious ouer the wickednesse of thy people.
{32:13} Remembre thy seruautes Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, vnto who thou swarest by thyne owne self, and saydest: I wil multiplye youre sede as the starres of heauen, and all the londe that I haue promysed you, wil I geue vnto youre sede, & they shall inheret it for euer.
{32:14} Thus the LORDE repented of the euell, which he sayde he wolde do vnto his people.
{32:15} Moses turned him, & wente downe from the mount, and in his hande he had the two tables of wytnesse, which were wrytte vpon both the sydes,
{32:16} and were Gods worke, & the wrytinge was the wrytinge of God therin.
{32:17} Now whan Iosua herde the noyse of ye people, as they shouted, he sayde vnto Moses: This is a noyse of warre in the hoost.
{32:18} He answered: It is not a noyse of them that haue the victory, and of them that haue the worse, but I heare a noyse of synginge at a daunse.
{32:19} Whan he came nye vnto the hoost, and sawe the calfe, and the daunsynge, he was moued with wrath, and cast the tables out of his hande, and brake them beneth the mount.
{32:20} And he toke the calfe that they had made, and brent it with fyre, and stamped it vnto poulder, and strowed it in the water, & gaue it vnto the children of Israel to drynke,
{32:21} & sayde vnto Aaron: What dyd this people vnto the, that thou hast brought so greate a synne vpon them?
{32:22} Aaron sayde: Let not the wrath of my lorde waxe fearce: thou knowest, that this is a wicked people.
{32:23} They sayde vnto me: Make vs goddes to go before vs, for we cannot tell what is become of this man Moses, yt brought vs out of the londe of Egipte.
{32:24} I sayde vnto them: Who so hath golde, let him plucke it of, and geue it me: and I cast it in the fyre, therof came this calfe.
{32:25} Now whan Moses sawe, that the people were naked (for Aaron, whan he set them vp, made them naked to their shame)
{32:26} he wete in to the gate of the hoost, and sayde: who so belongeth vnto the LORDE, let him come hither vnto me. Then all the children of Leui gathered them selues vnto him,
{32:27} and he sayde vnto them: Thus sayeth the LORDE the God of Israel: Euery man put his swerde by his syde, and go thorow in and out from one gate to another in the hoost, and slaye euery man his brother, frende, & neghboure.
{32:28} The children of Leui dyd, as Moses sayde vnto them. And there fell of the people the same daye thre thousande men.
{32:29} The sayde Moses: Cosecrate youre handes this daie vnto the LORDE, euery man vpon his sonne and brother, that the prayse maye be geuen ouer you this daye.
{32:30} On the morow Moses sayde vnto the people: Ye haue done a greate synnne. Now I wil go vp vnto the LORDE, yf peraduenture I maye make an attonement for youre synnes.
{32:31} Now wha Moses came agayne vnto ye LORDE, he saide: Oh this people haue done a greate synne, & haue made them goddes of golde.
{32:32} Now for geue them their synne: yf not, the wype me out of yi boke, that thou hast wrytten.
{32:33} The LORDE sayde vnto Moses: What? Him that synneth against me, wil I wype out of my boke.
{32:34} Go thou yi waye therfore, and brynge ye people thither as I haue sayde vnto the, Beholde, myne angell shall go before the. But in the daye of my visitacion I wyll vyset their synnes vpon them.
{32:35} So the LORDE plaged the people, because they made ye calfe which Aaron made.
{33:1} The LORDE sayde vnto Moses: Go, departe hence, thou and the people, whom thou hast brought out of the lande of Egipte, vnto ye londe that I sware vnto Abraham, Isaac and Iacob, and sayde: vnto yi sede wil I geue it,
{33:2} and I wyl sende an angell before the (and cast out the Cananites, Amorites, Hethites, Pheresites, Heuites and Iebusites)
{33:3} in to the londe that floweth with mylke and hony, for I wyll not go vp with the: for thou art an hardnecked people, I might consume the by the waye.
{33:4} Whan the people herde this euell tydinges, they sorowed, and no man put on his best rayment.
{33:5} And ye LORDE sayde vnto Moses: Speake vnto the children of Israel: Ye are a styfnecked people, I must once come sodenly vpon the, and make an ende of the. And now put of thy goodly araye from the, yt I maie knowe what to do vnto the.
{33:6} So the children of Israel laied their goodly araye from the, euen before the mount Horeb.
{33:7} Moses toke the Tabernacle, & pitched it without afarre of from ye hoost, and called it the Tabernacle of wytnesse. And who so euer wolde axe eny question at the LORDE, wente out vnto the Tabernacle of wytnesse before the hoost.
{33:8} And whan Moses wente out vnto the Tabernacle, all the people rose vp, and stode euery one in his tent dore, and loked after Moses, tyll he was gone in to the Tabernacle.
{33:9} And whan Moses entred in to the Tabernacle, the cloudy pyler came downe, and stode in the dore of the Tabernacle, and he talked with Moses.
{33:10} And all the people sawe the cloudy piler stonde in the dore of the Tabernacle, and rose vp, and worshiped, euery one in his tent dore.
{33:11} And the LORDE spake vnto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh vnto his frende. And whan he turned agayne to the hoost, ye yonge ma Iosua ye sonne of Nun his minister, departed not out of ye Tabernacle.
{33:12} And Moses sayde vnto the LORDE: Beholde, thou saydest vnto me: Brynge ye people vp, and lettest me not knowe, whom thou wilt sende wt me, & yet hast thou sayde: I knowe the by name, and thou hast founde grace in my sight.
{33:13} Let me knowe thy waye therfore, wherby I maye be certified, yt I fynde grace in thy sight: And consydre yet, that this people is thy people.
{33:14} He sayde: My presence shal go before the, there with wyll I lede the.
{33:15} But he sayde vnto him: Yf thy presence go not, then cary vs not vp from hence:
{33:16} for wherby shal it be knowne, yt I and thy people haue founde fauoure in thy sight, but in yt thou goest with vs? that I & thy people maye haue some preemynence before all people that are vpon the face of the earth.
{33:17} The LORDE sayde vnto Moses: I wyll do this also that thou hast sayde, for thou hast foude grace in my sight, and I knowe the by name.
{33:18} He sayde: Oh let me the se thy glory.
{33:19} And he sayde: I wyl cause all my good go ouer before thy face, and wyl let the name of ye LORDE be called vpon before the. And I shewe mercy, to whom I shewe mercy: and haue compassion, on whom I haue compassion.
{33:20} And he sayde morouer: Thou mayest not se my face, for there shall no ma lyue, yt seyth me.
{33:21} And ye LORDE sayde farthermore: beholde, there is a place by me, there shalt thou stode vpon the rocke.
{33:22} Now whan my glory goeth forth, I wil put ye in a clyfte of ye rocke, & my hande shal holde styll vpo the, tyll I be passed by.
{33:23} And whan I take awaye myne hande from the, thou shalt se my back partes, but my face shal not be sene.
{34:1} And the LORDE sayde vnto Moses: Hew the two tables of stone, like as ye first were, that I maye wryte in them the wordes, yt were in the first tables, which thou brakest:
{34:2} and be ready in the mornynge, that thou mayest come vp early vnto mout Sinai, and stonde me vpon the toppe of the mount.
{34:3} And let no man come vp with the, that there be no man sene thorow out all ye mount: and let nether shepe ner oxen fede before the mount.
{34:4} And Moses hewed two tables of stone, like as the first were, & arose early in the mornynge, & wente vp vnto mount Sinai, as ye LORDE comaunded him, & toke ye two tables of stone in his hade.
{34:5} The came the LORDE downe in a cloude. And there he stepte vnto him, & called vpo ye name of ye LORDE.
{34:6} And whan ye LORDE passed by before his face, he cryed: LORDE LORDE, God, mercifull & gracious, & longe sufferinge, and of greate mercy and trueth,
{34:7} thou that kepest mercy in stoare for thousandes, and forgeuest wickednes, trespace and synne (before whom there is no man innocent) thou that visitest the wickednesse of the fathers vpon ye children and childers children, vnto the thirde and fourth generacion.
{34:8} And Moses bowed him self downe vnto the earth, and worshiped him,
{34:9} and saide: LORDE, yf I haue founde grace in thy sight, the let the LORDE go with vs (for it is an hard necked people) that thou mayest haue mercy vpon oure wickednesses and synnes, and let vs be thyne inheritaunce.
{34:10} And he sayde: Beholde, I make a couenaunt before all yi people, & wil do wonders, soch as haue not bene done in all londes, and amonge all people. And all ye people amoge whom thou art, shal se ye worke of ye LORDE, for a terryble thinge shal it be, yt I wyl do wt the.
{34:11} Kepe that I commaunde ye this daye. Beholde, I wyl cast out before the: ye Amorites, Cananites, Hethites, Pheresites, Heuytes and Iebusites.
{34:12} Bewarre, that thou make no couenaunt with the indwellers of the lande yt thou commest in to, lest they be cause of yi ruyne in the myddest of the:
{34:13} but their alters shalt thou ouerthrowe, & breake downe their goddes, and rote out their groaues:
{34:14} for thou shalt worshipe no other god. For ye LORDE is called gelous, because he is a gelous God:
{34:15} lest (yf thou make any agrement with the indwellers of the londe, and whan they go a whoringe after their goddes, and do sacrifice vnto their goddes) they call ye, and thou eate of their sacrifice,
{34:16} and lest thou take of their doughters vnto thy sonnes to wyues, and the same go a whoringe after their goddes,
{34:17} & make thy sonnes go a whoringe after their goddes also. Thou shalt make ye no goddes of metall.
{34:18} The feast of swete bred shalt thou kepe. Seuen daies shalt thou eate vnleueded bred, like as I comaunded the in the tyme of the moneth Abib: for in the moneth Abib thou wentest out of Egipte.
{34:19} All yt first breaketh the Matrix, is myne, soch as shalbe male amoge ye catell, yt breaketh the Matrix, whether it be oxe or shepe.
{34:20} But the first of thyne Asse shalt thou bye out wt a shepe: yf thou redeme it not, then breake his necke. All the first borne of thy children shalt thou redeme. And se that no man appeare before me emptye.
{34:21} Sixe dayes shalt thou labor, vpon ye seueth daye shalt thou rest both from plowinge and reapynge.
{34:22} The feast of wekes shalt thou kepe with the firstlinges of the wheate haruest: and the feast of yngaderynge at ye yeares ende.
{34:23} Thryse in a yeare shal all yor men children appeare before the Souernoure, euen the LORDE and God of Israel.
{34:24} Whan I shal cast out the Heithen before the, & enlarge yi borders, there shal no man desyre thy lode: for so moch as thou goest vp thre tymes in the yeare, to appeare before ye LORDE thy God.
{34:25} Thou shalt not offer the bloude of my sacrifice wt leueded bred. And the offerynge of the Easterfeast shal not remayne ouer night vntill the mornynge.
{34:26} The firstlinges of ye first frutes of thy lode shalt thou brynge in to the house of the LORDE thy God. Thou shalt not seith a kydd, whyle it is yet in his mothers mylke.
{34:27} And the LORDE saide vnto Moses: wryte these wordes, for because of these wordes haue I made a couenaunt with the & with Israel.
{34:28} And he was there with the LORDE fourtye dayes and fourtye nightes, and ate no bred, and dranke no water. And he wrote in the tables the wordes of the couenaut, euen ten verses.
{34:29} Now wha Moses came downe fro mout Sinai, he had the two tables of wytnesse in his hande, & wyst not yt the skynne of his face shyned, because he had talked with him.
{34:30} And wha Aaron & all the childre of Israel sawe yt the skynne of his face shyned, they were afrayed to come nye him.
{34:31} The Moses called them. And they returned vnto him, both Aaron & all the chefest of the cogregacion. And he talked wt them.
{34:32} Afterwarde came all the children of Israel vnto him. And he comaunded the, all yt the LORDE had sayde vnto him vpon the mount Sinai.
{34:33} Now whan he had made an ende of talkynge wt the, he put a couerynge vpo his face.
{34:34} And whan he wete in before ye LORDE to talke wt him, he toke ye couerynge of, till he wete out agayne. And whan he came forth & spake wt the childre of Israel what was comaunded him,
{34:35} the the childre of Israel sawe his face, how yt the skynne of his face shyned: so he put the couerynge vpo his face agayne, tyll he wente in agayne to talke with him.
{35:1} And Moses gathered all the cogregacion of ye childre of Israel together, and sayde vnto them: This is it, yt the LORDE hath commaunded you to do:
{35:2} Sixe dayes shall ye worke, but the seuenth daye shall ye kepe holy: a Sabbath of the LORDES rest. Who so euer doeth eny worke therin, shall dye.
{35:3} Ye shal kyndle no fyre vpon the Sabbath daye in all youre dwellynges.
{35:4} And Moses sayde vnto ye whole congregacion of the children of Israel: This is it, that the LORDE hath commaunded:
{35:5} Geue from amonge you Heue offerynges vnto ye LORDE, so that euery one brynge the LORDES Heue offerynge with a fre hert: golde, syluer, brasse,
{35:6} yalowe sylke, scarlet, purple, whyte sylke, and goates hayre,
{35:7} reed skynnes of rammes, doo skynnes, and Fyrre tre,
{35:8} oyle for the lampes, and spyces for the anoyntinge oyle and for swete incense.
{35:9} Onix stones, and stones to be set in ye ouerbody cote, and for the brestlappe.
{35:10} And who so is wyse of hert amonge you, let him come, & make what the LORDE hath commaunded:
{35:11} namely,the Habitacion with the tent & couerynge therof, the rynges, bordes, barres, pilers & sokettes:
{35:12} The Arke wt the staues therof, the Mercyseate & the vayle:
{35:13} the table with his staues & all his apparell: & the shewbred:
{35:14} The cadilsticke of light and his apparell, and his lampes, & the oyle for the lightes:
{35:15} The altare of incense with his staues: The anoyntynge oyle and spyces for incense: The hangynge before ye Tabernacle dore:
{35:16} The alter of burntofferynges with his brasen gredyron, staues and all his apparell: The lauer with his fote:
{35:17} The hanginges of the courte, with the pilers and sokettes therof, & the hangynge of the courte dore:
{35:18} The nales of the habitacion and of ye courte with their coardes:
{35:19} The mynistringe garmentes for the seruyce in the Holy, ye holy vestimentes of Aaron the prest wt the vestimentes of his sonnes for ye prestes office.
{35:20} Then wente all the congregacion of the childre of Israel out fro Moses,
{35:21} & euery one brought the gift of his hert: & all that they wolde of fre will, the same brought they for an Heue offerynge vnto the LORDE for ye worke of the Tabernacle of witnesse, & for all the seruyce therof, & for the holy vestimetes.
{35:22} Both men & wemen that were of a wyllynge hert, brought bracelettes, earynges, rynges & gyrdels, and all maner Iewels of golde: Euery man also brought golde for Waue offerynges vnto the LORDE.
{35:23} And who so euer foude by him yalow sylke, scarlet, purple, whyte sylke, goates hayre, reed skynnes of rames, and Doo skynnes, brought it.
{35:24} And who so euer houe vp syluer & brasse, brought it for ye Heue offerynge vnto the LORDE. And who so euer founde Fyrre tre by him, brought it for all maner of worke of the Gods seruyce.
{35:25} And soch wemen as were wyse herted, spanne with their hades, and brought their sponne worke of yalow sylke, scarlet, purple, and whyte sylke.
{35:26} And soch wemen as had hye vnderstondinge in wysdome, spanne goates hayre.
{35:27} As for ye prynces, they brought Onix stones, and set stones, for ye ouerbody coate, and for the brestlappe,
{35:28} and spyces, and oyle for ye lightes, and for the anoyntinge oyle, and for swete incense.
{35:29} Thus the children of Israel brought fre wyllynge offerynges, both man and weme, for all maner of worke, that the LORDE had commaunded by Moses, to be made.
{35:30} And Moses saide vnto the childre of Israel: Beholde, ye LORDE hath called by name Bezaleel ye sonne of Vri, ye sonne of Hur of the trybe of Iuda,
{35:31} & hath fylled him wt the sprete of God, that he maye haue wysdome, vnderstondinge, & knowlege for all maner of worke,
{35:32} to worke connyngly in golde, syluer & brasse,
{35:33} to graue precious stones & to set them, to carue in wodd, to make all maner of connynge workes,
{35:34} and hath geue instruccion in his hert, both him and Ahaliab the sonne of Ahisamach of ye trybe of Dan.
{35:35} These hath he fylled wt wysdome of hert, to make all maner of worke, to carue, to broder, to worke with nedle worke, with yalow sylke, scarlet, purple and whyte sylke, and with weeuynge to make all maner of worke, and to deuyse connynge workes.
{36:1} Then wrought Bezaleel & Ahaliab & all the wyse herted men, vnto whom the LORDE had geuen wysdome & vnderstondinge to knowe, how they shulde make all maner worke for the seruyce of the Sanctuary, acordinge vnto all yt the LORDE commaunded.
{36:2} And Moses called for Bezaleel & Ahaliab, & all the wyse herted men, vnto whom the LORDE had geuen wysdome in their hertes, namely, all soch as wyllingly offred them selues there, & came to laboure in the worke.
{36:3} And they receaued of Moses all the Heue offerynges, that the children of Israel had brought for the worke of the seruyce of the Sanctuary, that it might be made: & euery morninge brought they their willinge offerynges vnto him.
{36:4} Then came all the wyse men yt wrought in the worke of the Sanctuary, euery one fro his worke that he made,
{36:5} & sayde vnto Moses: The people bryngeth to moch, more the nede is for the worke of this seruice, which the LORDE hath comaunded to make.
{36:6} The commaunded Moses, that it shulde be proclamed thorow out the hoost: No man brynge more to the Heue offerynge of the Sanctuary. Then were the people forbydden to brynge:
{36:7} for there was stuff ynough for all maner of worke, that was to be made, and to moch.
{36:8} So all ye wyse herted men amonge the yt wrought in ye worke of the Habitacion, made ten curtaynes of whyte twyned sylke, yalow sylke, scarlet, purple, with Cherubyns of broderd worke.
{36:9} The legth of one curtayne was eight and twentye cubites, and the bredth foure cubites, & were all of one measure:
{36:10} & he coupled the curtaynes fyue & fyue together one to the other.
{36:11} And made yalow loupes a longe by ye edge of euery curtayne, where they shulde be coupled together:
{36:12} fiftie loupes vpo euery curtayne, wherby one might be coupled to another.
{36:13} And made fiftie buttons of golde, and with the buttons he coupled the curtaynes together one to the other, that it might be one couerynge.
{36:14} And he made xj. curtaynes of goates hayre (for the tent ouer the habitacion)
{36:15} of thirtie cubytes longe, & foure cubytes brode, all of one measure,
{36:16} & coupled fyue together by them selues, and sixe by them selues,
{36:17} & made fiftie loupes a longe by ye edge of euery curtayne, wherby they might be coupled together,
{36:18} & made fiftie buttons of brasse, to couple ye tent together withall.
{36:19} And made ouer ye tent a couerynge of reed skynnes of rammes, and ouer that a couerynge of Doo skynnes.
{36:20} And made stondinge bordes for the Habitacion, of Fyrre tre,
{36:21} euery one ten cubytes longe, and a cubyte and a half brode,
{36:22} & two fete vnto euery one, wherby one might be ioyned to another:
{36:23} that on the south syde there stode twentye of the same bordes:
{36:24} and made fourtye syluer sokettes there vnder, vnder euery borde two sokettes for his two fete.
{36:25} In like maner for the other syde of the Habitacion towarde the north, he made twentye bordes
{36:26} also with fourtye syluer sokettes, vnder euery borde two sokettes:
{36:27} But behynde the Habitacion vpon the west syde, he made sixe bordes,
{36:28} and two other for the corners of the Habitacion behynde,
{36:29} that either of them both might be ioyned with his corner borde from vnder vp, and aboue vpon the heade to come together with a clampe:
{36:30} so that there were eight bordes, and sixtene sokettes of syluer, vnder euery one two sokettes.
{36:31} And he made barres of Fyrre tre, fyue for the bordes vpon the one syde of the Habitacion,
{36:32} and fyue vpon the other syde, and fyue behynde towarde the west:
{36:33} and made the barres to shute thorow the bordes, from the one ende to the other,
{36:34} and euerlayde the bordes with golde. But their rynges made he of golde for the barres, and ouerlayde ye barres with golde.
{36:35} And made Cherubyns vpon the hangynge with broderd worke, of yalow sylke, scarlet, purple, & whyte twyned sylke.
{36:36} And made for the same, foure pilers of Fyrretre, and ouerlayed them with golde, and their knoppes of golde, and cast foure sokettes of syluer for them.
{36:37} And made an hanginge in the Tabernacle dore, of yalow sylke, scarlet, purple, and whyte twyned sylke, of nedle worke,
{36:38} and fyue pilers therto with their knoppes (& ouerlayed their knoppes and whopes with golde) and fyue sokettes of brasse there to.
{37:1} And Bezaleel made the Arke of Fyrre tre, two cubites and a half loge, a cubyte and a half brode, and a cubyte & a half hye,
{37:2} and ouerlayed it with fyne golde within and without, and made a crowne of golde vnto it rounde aboute,
{37:3} and cast for it foure rynges of golde to the foure corners of it, vpon euery syde two.
{37:4} And made staues of Fyrre tre, and ouerlayed the with golde,
{37:5} and put them in the rynges a longe by ye sydes of the Arke, to beare it withall.
{37:6} And he made ye Mercyseate of pure golde two cubytes and a half longe, and a cubite and a half brode,
{37:7} & made two Cherubyns of fyne beaten golde vpon the two endes of the Mercyseate:
{37:8} One Cherub vpon the one ende, and the other Cherub vpon the other ende:
{37:9} and the Cherubyns spredde out their wynges aboue an hye, and couered ye Mercyseate ther with: and their faces stode one ouer agaynst the other, and loked vnto the Mercyseate.
{37:10} And he made ye table, of Fyrre tre, two cubytes longe, a cubyte brode, and a cubyte & a half hye,
{37:11} and ouerlayed it with fyne golde, and made therto a crowne of golde rounde aboute,
{37:12} and made vnto it an whoope of an hande bredth hye, and made a crowne of golde rounde aboute the whoope.
{37:13} And for it he cast foure golde rynges, & put them in the foure corners by the fete
{37:14} harde by the whoope, that the staues might be therin, to beare the table with all:
{37:15} & made the staues of Fyrre tre, and ouerlayed the with golde, to beare the staues withall.
{37:16} And the vessels vpon the table made he also of fyne golde: the disshes, spones, flat peces and pottes, to poure in and out withall.
{37:17} And he made the candilsticke of fyne beaten golde, where vpon was the shaft wt brauches, cuppes, knoppes, & floures:
{37:18} Sixe braunches proceaded out of ye sydes therof, vpon either syde thre brauches:
{37:19} vpo euery brauch were thre cuppes like allmodes, wt knoppes and floures.
{37:20} Vpon the candilsticke self were foure cuppes with knoppes and floures,
{37:21} vnder euery two brauches a knoppe.
{37:22} The knoppes & braunches therof proceaded out of it, and were all one pece of fyne beaten golde.
{37:23} And he made the seuen lampes with their snoffers & outquenchers of pure golde.
{37:24} Of an hudreth weight of golde made he it, and all the apparell therof.
{37:25} He made also the altare of incense, of Fyrre tre, a cubyte longe and brode, eauen foure squared, and two cubytes hye with the hornes of it,
{37:26} and ouerlayed it with fyne golde, the toppe and the sydes of it rounde aboute,
{37:27} and the hornes therof, and made a crowne vnto it rounde aboute of pure golde, & two golde rynges vnder the crowne on both the sydes, to put the staues therin, and to beare it withall:
{37:28} but the staues made he of Fyrre tre, and ouerlayed them with golde.
{37:29} And he made the holy anoyntinge oyle, & the incense of pure spyces, after ye craft of the Apotecary.
{38:1} And the altare of burntoffrynges made he of Fyrre tre, fyue cubytes loge & brode, eauen foure squared, & thre cubites hye.
{38:2} And made foure hornes, which proceaded out of the foure corners therof, and ouerlaied it with brasse.
{38:3} And he made all maner of vessels for the altare, cauldrons, shouels, basens, fleshokes, and colepannes all of brasse.
{38:4} And vnto the altare he made a brasen gredyron of net worke rounde aboute, from vnder vp vnto the myddest of the altare,
{38:5} & cast foure rynges in the foure corners of the brasen gredyron, for the staues:
{38:6} which he made of Fyrre tre, and ouerlayed them wt brasse,
{38:7} and put them in the rynges by the sydes of the altare, to beare it withall, and made it holowe with bordes.
{38:8} And he made the Lauer of brasse, & his fote also of brasse vpon the place of ye hoost, that laye before the dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse.
{38:9} And he made the courte on ye south syde: hangynges an hundreth cubytes longe, of whyte twyned sylke,
{38:10} with the twetye pilers therof, and twentye sokettes of brasse: but the knoppes and whopes of syluer.
{38:11} In like maner vpon the north syde an hundreth cubytes with twentye pilers, and twentye sokettes of brasse, but their knoppes & whoopes of syluer.
{38:12} Vpon the west syde fiftie cubytes with ten pilers and te sokettes, but their knoppes and whoopes of syluer.
{38:13} Vpon the East syde fiftie cubytes.
{38:14} Fiftene cubytes vpon either syde of the courte dore, wt thre pilers and thre sokettes:
{38:15} KJV: And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and that hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three.
{38:16} So that all the hanginges of the courte were of whyte twyned sylke,
{38:17} and the sokettes of the pilers were of brasse, & their knoppes and whoopes of syluer: their heades were ouerlayed wt syluer, & all the pilers of the courte were whooped aboute with syluer.
{38:18} And the hangynge in ye courte gate made he wt nedle worke, of yalowe sylke, scarlet, purple, & whyte twyned sylke, twentye cubytes longe, & fyue cubytes hye, after the measure of the hanginges of the courte:
{38:19} foure pilers also therto, & foure sokettes of brasse, and their knoppes of syluer, and their heades ouerlayed, and their whoopes of syluer.
{38:20} And all the nales of the Habitacion and of the courte rounde aboute, were of brasse.
{38:21} This is now the summe of the Habitacion of wytnesse (which was counted at the comaundemet of Moses to ye Gods seruice of the Leuites vnder the hade of Ithamar the sonne of Aaron the prest)
{38:22} which Bezaleel the sonne of Vri, the sonne of Hur of the trybe of Iuda made, all as the LORDE commaunded Moses.
{38:23} And wt him Ahaliab ye sonne of Ahisamach of the trybe of Dan, a connynge grauer, to worke nedle worke, wt yalow sylke, scarlet, purple, & whyte sylke.
{38:24} All the golde yt was wrought in all this worke of the Sanctuary (which was geuen to the Waue offerynge) is nyne & twenty hudreth weight, seuen hundreth & thirtie Sycles, after ye Sycle of ye Sanctuary.
{38:25} The syluer yt came of the congregacion, was fyue score hundreth weight, a thousande, seuen hundreth, fyue and seuentye Sycles, after ye Sycle of the Sanctuary:
{38:26} so many heades so many half Sycles, after the Sycle of the Sanctuary, of all that were nombred from twentye yeare olde and aboue, euen sixe hundreth thousande, thre thousande, fyue hundreth and fiftye.
{38:27} Of the fyue score hundreth weight of syluer, were cast the sokettes of the Sanctuary, and the sokettes of the vayle, an hudreth sokettes of the fyue score hundreth weight, an hundreth weight to euery sokett.
{38:28} Of the thousande, seuen hundreth and fyue and seuentye Sycles were made the knoppes of the pilers (and their heades ouerlayed) and their whoopes.
{38:29} As for the Waue offerynge of brasse, it was seuentye hundreth weight, two thousande and foure hundreth Sycles:
{38:30} Wherof were made the sokettes in the dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse, and the brasen altare, and the brasen gredyron therto, and all the vessels of the altare,
{38:31} and the sokettes of ye courte rounde aboute, and the sokettes of ye courte gate, all ye nales of the Habitacion, & all ye nales of ye courte rounde aboute.
{39:1} Of the yalowe sylke, scarlet, & purple, they made Aarons mynistringe vestimentes, to do seruyce in the Sanctuary, as ye LORDE comaunded Moses.
{39:2} And he made the ouer body cote, of golde, yalowe sylke, scarlet, purple, & whyte twyned sylke,
{39:3} and bett the golde in to thinne plates, and cut it in to wyres, that it might be wrought amonge the yalowe sylke, scarlet, purple and whyte sylke,
{39:4} & made it so, that ye ouerbody cote came together by the edges on both the sydes.
{39:5} And his gyrdel was after the same craft & worke: eue of golde, yalowe sylke, scarlet, purple and whyte twyned sylke, as the LORDE commaunded Moses.
{39:6} And they wrought two Onix stones, set rounde aboute with golde, grauen by the stone grauer with the names of the childre of Israel:
{39:7} and fastened them vpo the shulders of the ouerbody cote, that they might be stones of remebraunce vnto the children of Israel, as the LORDE comaunded Moses.
{39:8} And they made the brestlappe after the craft & worke of the ouerbody cote: of golde, yalowe sylke, scarlet, purple, & whyte twyned sylke,
{39:9} so that it was foure square & dubble, an hande bredth longe and brode,
{39:10} and fylled it with foure rowes of stones. The first rowe was: a Sardis, a Topas, and a Smaragde.
{39:11} The secode: a Ruby, a Saphyre, and a Dyamonde.
{39:12} The thirde: a Ligurios, an Achat, and an Amatist.
{39:13} The fourth: a Turcas, an Onix & a Iaspis: closed rounde aboute with golde in all the rowes.
{39:14} And the stones stode after the twolue names of the children of Israel, grauen by the stone grauer, euery one with his name, acordinge to the twolue trybes.
{39:15} And vpon the brestlappe they made wrythen cheynes of pure golde,
{39:16} and two hokes of golde, & two golde rynges, and fastened the two rynges vpon the two edges of the brestlappe:
{39:17} and ye two wrythen cheynes put they in the two rynges vpon the corners of the brestlappe.
{39:18} But the two endes of ye wrethen cheynes put they to the two hokes, & fastened them vpon the corners of the ouerbody cote, one ouer agaynst another.
{39:19} And they made two other rynges of golde, & fastened them to the other two corners of the brestlappe by the edge of it, that it might hange vpon the out syde of the ouerbody cote.
{39:20} And they made yet two other golde rynges, which they put beneth vpon the two corners of the ouerbody cote, one ouer agaynst another, where the ouerbody cote ioyneth together,
{39:21} that the brestlappe might be festened by his rynges vnto ye rynges of the ouerbody cote with a yalowe lace, that it might lye close vpon ye ouerbody cote, and not be lowsed from ye ouerbody cote, as the LORDE commaunded Moses.
{39:22} And he made the tunycle vnto the ouerbody cote, wrought all of yalow sylke,
{39:23} & the hole therof aboue in the myddest, & a bonde folde together rounde aboute the hole, that it shulde not rente.
{39:24} And beneth vpon ye hemme of it, they made pomgranates of yalow sylke, scarlet, purple, & whyte twyned sylke:
{39:25} & they made belles of pure golde, which they put betwixte ye pomgranates rounde aboute vpon the hemme of the tunycle, a bell & a pomgranate,
{39:26} a bell & a pomgranate rounde aboute, to do seruyce in, as the LORDE commaunded Moses.
{39:27} And they made albes also wrought of whyte sylke for Aaron & his sonnes,
{39:28} & ye myter of whyte sylke, and the goodly bonettes of whyte sylke, and breches of twyned whyte lynnen,
{39:29} and the girdle of nedle worke euen of whyte twyned sylke, yalow sylke, scarlet, and purple, as the LORDE commaunded Moses.
{39:30} They made the fore heade plate also to ye holy crowne, of pure golde, and wrote therin with grauen worke: the holynes of the LORDE,
{39:31} and festened a yalowe lace theron, to tye it vnto the myter aboue, as the LORDE comaunded Moses.
{39:32} Thus the whole worke of ye Habitacion of ye Tabernacle of wytnesse, was fynished. And the childre of Israel dyd all that the LORDE comaunded Moses,
{39:33} & brought the Habitacion vnto Moses: the Tabernacle & all the apparell therof, the buttons, bordes, barres, pilers, sokettes,
{39:34} ye couerynge of reed skynnes of rammes, the couerynge of doo skynnes, & the vayle,
{39:35} ye Arke of wytnesse wt the staues therof, the Mercyseate,
{39:36} the table & all his apparell, & the shewbred,
{39:37} the candilsticke, wt the lampes prepared, and all his apparell, & oyle for the lightes,
{39:38} the golden altare, the anoyntinge oyle & incense, the hanginge in the Tabernacle dore,
{39:39} the brasen altare, & his brasen gredyron wt his staues, & all his apparell, ye lauer wt his foote,
{39:40} the hangynges of ye courte wt the pilers & sokettes therof, ye hanginge in the courte gate wt his pilers & nales, & all the ordynaunce for the seruyce of the Habitacion of ye Tabernacle of wytnesse,
{39:41} ye mynistringe vestimetes of Aaro ye prest, to do seruyce in ye Sanctuary, & the garmetes of his sonnes, yt they might execute ye prestes office.
{39:42} Acordinge to all that ye LORDE comaunded Moses, eue so dyd the childre of Israel in all this seruyce.
{39:43} And Moses sawe all ye worke, yt they dyd it eue as ye LORDE had commaunded, and he blessed them.
{40:1} And ye LORDE spake vnto Moses, & sayde:
{40:2} In the fyrst daye of the first moneth shalt thou set vp ye Habitacio of ye Tabernacle of wytnesse,
{40:3} and shal put the Arke of wytnes therin, and hange the vayle before ye Arke.
{40:4} And thou shalt bringe in the table, and garnish it, and brynge in the cadilsticke, and put the lampes theron.
{40:5} And ye golde altare of incense shalt thou set before ye Arke of wytnesse, & hange vp the hanginge in the dore of the Habitacio.
{40:6} But the altare of burntofferinges shalt thou set before the dore of the Habitacion of the Tabernacle of wytnesse:
{40:7} & the lauer betwixte the Tabernacle of wytnesse and the altare, and put water therin,
{40:8} & set the courte rounde aboute, and hange vp the hanginge in the courte gate.
{40:9} And thou shalt take the anoyntynge oyle, and anoynte the Habitacion and all that is there in, and shalt consecrate it, and all ye apparell therof, that it maye be holy.
{40:10} And thou shalt anoynte the altare of burntofferynges and all his vessels, and consecrate it, that it maye be most holy.
{40:11} The lauer also & his fote shalt thou anoynte & consecrate.
{40:12} And thou shalt brynge Aaron & his sonnes vnto the dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse, and wash them with water,
{40:13} & put the holy vestimentes vpon Aaron, and anoynte him, and consecrate him, that he maye be my prest.
{40:14} And thou shalt brynge his sonnes also, and put the albes vpon them,
{40:15} and anoynte them, as thou hast anoynted their father, yt they maye be my prestes. And this anoyntinge shall they haue for an euerlastinge presthode amonge their posterities.
{40:16} And Moses dyd all as the LORDE comaunded him.
{40:17} Thus was the Tabernacle set vp in the seconde yeare vpon the first daye of the first moneth.
{40:18} And whan Moses reared it vp, he fastened ye sokettes and the bordes, and barres, and set vp the pilers,
{40:19} and spred out the tent ouer the Habitacion, and put the couerynge of the tent aboue an hye, as the LORDE commaunded him.
{40:20} And he toke the wytnesse, and layed it in the Arke, and put ye staues in the Arke, and set the Mercyseate aboue vpon the Arke,
{40:21} and brought the Arke in to the Habitacion, and hanged the vayle before the Arke of wytnesse, as the LORDE commaunded him.
{40:22} And he set the table in the Tabernacle of wytnesse, in the corner of the Habitacion vpon the north syde without the vayle,
{40:23} and prepared bred theron before ye LORDE as the LORDE commaunded him.
{40:24} And he set in the candilsticke also, euen ouer agaynst the table, in the corner of the Habitacion vpon the south syde,
{40:25} and put the lampes theron before ye LORDE, as the LORDE commaunded him.
{40:26} And the golden altare set he in also before the vayle,
{40:27} and brent swete incense theron, as the LORDE commaunded him.
{40:28} And hanged vp the hangynge in the Tabernacle dore.
{40:29} As for the altare of burntofferynges, he set it before the dore of the Habitacion of ye Tabernacle of wytnesse, and offred burntofferynges and meateofferynges theron, as the LORDE commaunded him.
{40:30} And the Lauer set he betwixte the Tabernacle of wytnesse and ye altare, and put water therin to wash withall.
{40:31} And Moses, Aaron and his sonnes washed their hades and fete ther at:
{40:32} for they ought to wash the, whan they wente in to the Tabernacle of wytnesse, or whan they wente vnto the altare, as the LORDE commaunded him.
{40:33} And he set vp the courte rounde aboute the Habitacion and the altare, and hanged vp ye hanginge in ye courte gate. Thus Moses fynished the whole worke.
{40:34} Then a cloude couered ye Tabernacle of wytnesse, and the glory of the LORDE fylled the Habitacion.
{40:35} And Moses coulde not go in to the Tabernacle of wytnesse, whyle the cloude abode theron, and the glory of ye LORDE fylled the Habitacion.
{40:36} And whan the cloude remoued from the Habitacion, then wente the children of Israel forth, as oft as they toke their iourney.
{40:37} But yf the cloude remoued not, then toke not they their iourney, tyll the daie that it remoued:
{40:38} for in the daye tyme was the cloude of the LORDE vpon the Habitacion, & in the night season was fyre therin, in ye sight of all ye house of Israel, in all their iourneis.

{1:1} These are the actes of Nehemias the sonne of Hachalia. It fortuned in ye moneth Chisleu in ye twetieth yeare, that I was in the castell at Susan:
{1:2} and Hanani one of my brethren came with certayne me of Iuda, and I axed them how the Iewes dyd that were delyuered and escaped from the captiuyte, & how it wente at Ierusale.
{1:3} And they sayde vnto me: The remnaunt of the captiuyte are there in the londe in greate mysfortune & rebuke. The walles of Ierusalem are broken downe, and the portes ther of are brent with fyre.
{1:4} Wha I herde these wordes, I sat me downe & wepte, & mourned two dayes, & fasted & prayed before the God of heauen,
{1:5} & sayde: O LORDE God of heauen, thou greate & terrible God, thou yt kepest couenaunt & mercy for them yt loue the & obserue thy comaundementes:
{1:6} let yi eares marke, & let thine eies be open, yt thou mayest heare the prayer of yi seruaunt, which I praye now before ye daye and nighte for the children of Israel thy seruauntes, & knowlege the synnes of the children of Israel, which we haue commytted agaynst the. And I & my fathers house haue synned also.
{1:7} We haue bene corrupte vnto the, in yt we haue not kepte the comaundementes, statutes & lawes, which thou comaundedst yi seruaunt Moses.
{1:8} Yet call to remembraunce ye worde that thou comaundedst thy seruaunt Moses, and saydest: Yf ye trasgresse, then wil I scater you abrode amonge the nacios.
{1:9} But yf ye turne vnto me, and kepe my commaundementes & do them: though ye were cast out vnto the vttemost parte of heauen yet wyl I gather you from thence, and wyll brynge you from thence, eue vnto the place, that I haue chosen for my name to dwell there.
{1:10} They are thy seruauntes, and thy people, whom thou hast delyuered thorow thy greate power & mightie hande.
{1:11} O LORDE, let thine eares marke the prayer of thy seruaunt, & the prayer of thy seruauntes, whose desyre is to feare thy name, & let thy seruaunt prospere this daye, & graunte him mercy in the sight of this man: for I was the kynges butlar.
{2:1} In the moneth Nisan of the twentieth yeare of kynge Artaxerses, wha the wyne stode before him, I toke vp the wyne, and gaue it vnto ye kynge, and I was heuy in his presence.
{2:2} Then sayde ye kynge vnto me: Why lokest thou so sadly? Thou art not sicke, that is not ye matter, but thou art heuy harted. Neuertheles I was sore afrayed,
{2:3} & sayde vnto the kynge: God saue the kynges life for euer, shulde I not loke sadly? the cite of my fathers buryall lyeth wayest, & the portes therof are consumed wt the fyre.
{2:4} Then sayde the kynge vnto me: What is the thy request? Then made I my prayer to the God of heaue,
{2:5} and sayde vnto the kynge: yf it please the kynge, and yf thy seruaunt be fauoured in thy sighte, I beseke the sende me in to Iuda vnto ye cite of my fathers buryall, that I maye buylde it.
{2:6} And ye kynge sayde vnto me, & so dyd the quene yt sat by him: How loge shal thy iourney cotynue, and wha wilt thou come agayne? And it pleased ye kynge to sende me, and I set him a tyme,
{2:7} & sayde vnto the kynge: Yf it please the kynge, let him geue me letters to the Debites beyonde ye water, yt they maye conueye me ouer, tyll I come in to Iuda:
{2:8} & letters vnto Assaph the lorde of the kynges wod, yt he maye geue me wodd for balkes to the gates of the palace, which are harde on the house & harde on the walles of the cite, & for the house that I shal entre in to. And ye kynge gaue me acordinge to the good hande of God vpo me.
{2:9} And whan I came to ye Debites beyonde the water, I gaue them ye kynges letters. And the kynge sent captaynes and horsmen with me.
{2:10} But whan Saneballath the Horonite, & Tobias the seruaunt of the Ammonites herde yt, it greued them sore, yt there was come a man which soughte the welth of the children of Israel.
{2:11} And whan I came to Ierusalem, & had bene there thre daies,
{2:12} I gat me vp in ye night season, & a fewe men with me: for I tolde no man what God had geue me in my hert to do at Ierusalem: & there was not one beest wt me, saue it yt I rode vpon.
{2:13} And I rode by nighte vnto the valley porte before the Dragon well, & to the Dongporte, & considered ye walles of Ierusalem that were broken downe, & the portes therof consumed wt the fyre.
{2:14} And I wente ouer vnto ye Well porte, & to the kynges condyte, & there was no rowme for my beest, yt it coulde go vnder me.
{2:15} Then wete I on in the nighte by the broke syde, & cosidered ye wall, & turned back, & came home agayne to ye valley porte.
{2:16} And ye rulers knewe not whither I wete, or what I dyd: for hither to had I not tolde the Iewes & the prestes, the councelers & the rulers, & the other yt laboured in the worke,
{2:17} & I saide vnto the: Ye se the myserye yt we are in, how Ierusale lyeth wayst, & how ye gates therof are brent wt fyre, come, let vs buylde vp ye walles of Ierusale, yt we be nomore a rebuke.
{2:18} And I tolde the of the good hade of my God which was vpo me: And ye kynges wordes yt he had spoke vnto me. And they saide: Then let vs get vp. And we buylded, and their handes were strengthed to good.
{2:19} But whan Saneballat ye Horonite, and Tobias the seruaunt of ye Ammonites, & Gosem the Arabian herde it, they laughed vs to scorne, and despised vs, & sayde: What is this that ye do? Wyll ye fall awaye agayne from the kynge?
{2:20} Then answered I them, and sayde: The God of heauen shal cause vs to prospere: for we his seruauntes are gotten vp, & are buyldinge. As for you, ye haue no porcio ner right, ner remembraunce in Ierusale.
{3:1} And Eliasib the hye prest gat him vp with his brethren the prestes, and buylded the Shepegate. They halowed it, and set vp the dores of it: euen vnto the tower Mea halowed they it, namely vnto the tower of Hananeel.
{3:2} Nexte vnto him buylded ye men of Iericho. And besyde him buylded Sachur the sonne of Imri.

{3:27} After him buylded they of Thecoa ye other pece ouer against ye greate tower, yt lieth outwarde, and vnto the wall of Ophel.
{3:28} But from the Horsgate forth buylded ye prestes, euery one ouer agaynst his house.
{3:29} After them buylded Sadoc ye sonne of Immer ouer against his house. After him buylded Semaia the sonne of Sachania ye keper of the eastgate.

{3:32} And betwene the perler of the corner vnto the Shepegate builded the goldsmythes and the marchauntes.
{4:1} Bvt whan Saneballat herde that we builded ye wall, he was wroth, & toke greate indignacio & mocked ye Iewes
{4:2} & saide before his brethre & the mightie men of Samaria: What do the impotet Iewes? shall they be thus suffred? shall they offre? shal they perfourme it in one daie? shal they make ye stones whole againe, yt are brought to dust, & brent?
{4:3} And Tobias the Ammonite beside him saide: Let the builde on, yf a foxe go vp, he shall breake downe their stonye wall.
{4:4} Heare O thou oure God, how we are despysed, turne their shame vpon their awne heade, yt thou mayest geue them ouer in to despisinge in the londe of their captiuite.
{4:5} Couer not their wickednesse, & put not out their sinne fro yi presence: for they haue prouoked the buylders.
{4:6} Yet buylded we the wall, & ioyned it whole together, vnto ye halfe heigth. And the people were well mynded to labor.
{4:7} But whan Saneballat, & Tobias, and ye Arabias, & Ammonites, & Asdodites herde, yt the walles of Ierusalem were made vp, and that they had begonne to stoppe vp ye gappes, they were very wroth,
{4:8} and cospyred all together, to come and fight against Ierusalem, & to make an hinderaunce therin.
{4:9} Neuertheles we made or praier vnto oure God, & set watchme vpo the wall daye & night ouer against them.
{4:10} And Iuda saide: The stregth of the bearers is to feble, & there is to moch dust, we are not able to builde on the wall.
{4:11} And or aduersaries thought: They shall not knowe nether se, tyll we come in the myddes amonge the, and slaye them, & hynder ye worke.
{4:12} But whan the Iewes that dwelt besyde them, came out of all the places where they dwelt aboute vs, and tolde vs as good as te tymes,
{4:13} then set I the people after their kynreds with their swerdes, speares & bowes beneth in the lowe places behynde the wall,
{4:14} & loked, and gat me vp, and sayde vnto the chefe men and rulers, & to the other people: Be not ye afrayed of them, thynke vpon ye greate LORDE which ought to be feared, & fighte for yor brethren, sonnes, daughters, wyues, & houses.
{4:15} Neuertheles whan or enemies herde yt we had gotten worde of it, God broughte their councell to naughte, and we turned all againe to the wall, euery one vnto his labor.
{4:16} And from that time forth it came to passe, yt the halfe parte of the yonge men dyd the laboure, & the other halfe parte helde the speares, shyldes, bowes, and brestplates, and the rulers stode behynde all the house of Iuda,
{4:17} which buylded on the wall, & bare burthes, from those that laded the. With one hande dyd they ye worke, and with the other helde they the weapen.
{4:18} And euery one yt buylded, had his swerde girde by his side, & so builded they. And the trompetters stode beside me.
{4:19} And I sayde vnto the pryncipall men, & rulers, and to ye other people: The worke is greate & large, & we are separated vpon the wall one farre from another.
{4:20} Loke in what place now ye heare the noise of ye trompe, resorte ye thither vnto vs. Oure God shal fight for vs,
{4:21} & we wil be labourige in ye worke. And the halfe parte of the helde ye speares fro ye morninge springe, till ye starres came forth.
{4:22} And at ye same tyme sayde I vnto ye people: Euery one abyde with his seruaunt at Ierusalem, yt in the night season we maye geue attendaunce to ye watch, and to laboure on the daye tyme.
{4:23} As for me and my brethren, & my seruauntes, and ye men of the watch behynde me, we put neuer of oure clothes, so so moch as to washe oure selues.
{5:1} And there arose a greate complaynte of ye people, & of their wyues against their brethren the Iewes.
{5:2} And there were some yt sayde: oure sonnes and doughters are to many, let vs take corne for the, & eate, that we maye lyue.
{5:3} Some saide: Let vs set or londes, vynyardes & houses to pledge, & take vp corne in the derth.
{5:4} But some saide: Let vs borowe money of the kinge vpo vsury for oure londes and vynyardes.
{5:5} Now are oure brethrens bodies as oure awne bodies, and their children as oure children: els shulde we subdue oure sonnes and doughters vnto bondage, and some of oure doughters are subdued allready, and no strength is there in oure handes, and other men shal haue oure londes and vynyardes.
{5:6} But whan I herde their complaynte and soch wordes, it displeased me sore,
{5:7} and I aduysed so in my mynde, yt I rebuked the councelers, and the rulers, and sayde vnto them: Wyl ye requyre vsury one of another? And I broughte a greate congregacion agaynst them,
{5:8} and sayde vnto them: We (after oure abilyte) haue boughte oure brethren the Iewes, which were solde vnto the Heythen. And wyl ye sell youre brethren, whom we haue boughte vnto vs? Then helde they their peace, & coulde fynde nothinge to answere.
{5:9} And I sayde: It is not good that ye do. Oughte ye not to walke in the feare of God, because of the rebuke of the Heythen oure enemies?
{5:10} I and my brethre, and my seruauntes haue lent them money and corne: but as for vsury, let vs leaue it.
{5:11} Therfore this same daye se that ye restore the their londes agayne, their vynyardes, oyle gardens and houses, and the hundreth parte of the money of the corne, wyne and oyle that ye haue wonne of them.
{5:12} Then sayde they: We wyl restore them agayne, and wyl requyre nothinge of them, and wyl do as thou hast spoken. And I called the prestes, and toke an ooth of the, that they shulde do so.
{5:13} And I shoke my lappe, and sayde: God shake out euery man after the same maner fro his house and laboure, that maynteyneth not this worde: euen thus be he shaken out, and voyde. And all ye congregacion sayde: Amen, and praysed the LORDE. And the people dyd so.
{5:14} And from the tyme forth that it was commytted vnto me to be a Debyte in the londe of Iuda, namely from the twentieth yeare vnto the two and thirtieth yeare off kynge Artaxerses (that is twolue yeare) I and my brethre lyued not of soch sustenaunbe as was geuen to a Debyte:
{5:15} For the olde Debytes that were before me, had bene chargeable vnto the people, and had take of the bred and wyne, and fortye Sycles of syluer: Yee and their seruauntes had oppressed the people. But so dyd not I, and that because of the feare of God.
{5:16} I laboured also in the worke vpon the wall, and boughte no lode. And all my seruautes came thither together vnto ye worke.
{5:17} Morouer there were at my table an hundreth and fiftie of the Iewes and rulers, which came vnto me, from amonge the Heythen, that are aboute vs.
{5:18} And there was prepared me daylie an oxe, and sixe chosen shepe, and byrdes, and euer once in ten dayes a greate summe of wyne. Yet requyred not I the lyuynge of a Debyte for ye bondage was greuous vnto ye people.
{5:19} Thynke vpo me my God vnto ye best, acordige to all that I haue done for this people.
{6:1} And whan Saneballat, Tobias and Gosem the Arabian, and the other of oure enemyes herde, that I had buylded the wall, and that there were no mo gappes ther in (howbeit at the same tyme had I not hanged the dores vpon the gates)
{6:2} Saneballat and Gosem sent vnto me, sayenge: Come and let us mete together in the vyllages vpon the playne of the cite Ono. Neuertheles they thoughte to do me euell.
{6:3} Notwithstondynge I sent messaungers vnto them, sayenge: I haue a greate busynes to do, I can not come downe. The worke shulde stonde still, yf I were necligent, and came downe to you.
{6:4} Howbeit they sent vnto me as good as foure tymes after the same maner. And I gaue the same answere.
{6:5} Then sent Saneballat his seruaunt vnto me the fifth tyme, with an open letter in his hande,
{6:6} wherin was wrytten: It is tolde the Heythen, & Gosem hath sayde it, that thou and the Iewes thynke to rebell: for ye which cause thou buyldest the wall, and wylt be their kynge in these matters,
{6:7} and hast ordeyned the prophetes to preach of the at Ierusalem, and to saye: He is kynge of Iuda. Now shal this come to the kynges eares: come now therfore, and let us take oure councell together.
{6:8} Neuertheles I sent vnto him, sayenge: There is no soch thinge done as thou sayest: thou hast fayned it out of thine owne hert.
{6:9} For they were all mynded to make us afrayed, and thoughte: They shal withdrawe their handes from the worke, yt they shal not laboure. Howbeit I stregthed my hande the more.
{6:10} And I came vnto ye house of Semaia ye sonne of Delaia the sonne of Mechetabeel, & he had shut him selfe within, & sayde: Let us come together in to ye house of God, eue vnto ye myddes of ye teple, & sparre ye dores of ye teple: for they wyl come to slaye ye, yee eue in the night wyl they come to put the to death.
{6:11} But I sayde: Shulde soch a ma flye? Shulde soch a ma as I am, go in to ye teple, to saue his life? I wyl not go in.
{6:12} For I perceaued, that God had not sent him: Yet spake he prophecye vpon me, neuerthelesse Tobias and Saneballat had hired him for money.
{6:13} Therfore toke he the money, that I shulde be afrayed, and so to do and synne, that they might haue an euell reporte of me, to blaspheme me.
{6:14} My God thynke thou vpon Tobias and Saneballat, acordynge vnto these their workes, and of ye prophet Noadia, and of the other prophetes, yt wolde haue put me in feare.
{6:15} And the wall was fynished on the fyue & twentyeth daye of the moneth Elul, in two and fyftye dayes.
{6:16} And whan all or enemies herde therof, all the Heithen yt were aboute vs, were afraied, and their corage failed the: for they perceaued, that this worke came of God.
{6:17} And at ye same tyme were there many of ye chefe of Iuda, whose letters wete vnto Tobias, & from Tobias vnto them
{6:18} for there were many in Iuda that were sworne vnto him: for he was the sonne in lawe of Sachania the sonne of Arah, and his sonne Iohanan had the doughter of Mesullam the sonne of Barachia,
{6:19} and they spake good of him before me, and tolde him my wordes. And Tobias sent letters, to put me in feare.
{7:1} Now whan we had buylded the wall I hanged on the dores, and the porters, syngers and Leuites were appoynted.
{7:2} And I comaunded my brother Hanam, and Hanama the ruler of the palace at Ierusalem: for he was a faithfull man, and feared God more then dyd many other
{7:3} and I sayde vnto them: Let not the gates of Ierusale be opened vntyll the Sonne be whote. And whyle they are yet stondinge in the watch, the dores shall be shut and barred. And there were certayne citesyns of Ierusalem appoynted to be watchmen, euery one in his watch, and aboute his house.
{7:4} As for ye cite, it was large of rowme, and greate, but ye people were fewe therin, and the houses were not buylded.
{7:5} And my God gaue me in my hert, that I gatherd together the pryncipall men and ye people, to nombre them, and I founde a register of their nombre, which came vp afore out of the captiuyte
{7:6} (whom Nabuchodonosor ye kynge of Babilo had caryed awaie) and dwelt at Ierusalem and in Iuda, euery one vnto his cite,

{8:2} And Esdras the prest brought ye lawe before the congregacio both of men and wemen, and of all that coulde vnderstonde it, vpon the first daye of the seuenth moneth,
{8:3} and red therin in the strete that is before the Watergate, from ye light mornynge vntyll the noone daye before men and wemen and soch as coulde vnderstonde it: and the eares of all the people were inclyned vnto the boke of the lawe.
{8:4} And Esdras the scrybe stode vpon an hye pulpit of wod, which they had made for the preachynge, & beside him stode Mathithia, Sema, Anania Vria, Ezechias, and Maeseia on his righte hand: And on his lefte honde stode Pedaia, Misael, Malchia, Hasum, Hasbadana, Zachary and Mesullam.
{8:5} And Esdras opened ye boke before all ye people, for he stode aboue all ye people. And whan he opened it, all the people stode vp.
{8:6} And Esdras praysed the LORDE the greate God. And all the people answered Amen, Amen, with their handes vp, and bowed the selues, and worshipped ye LORDE with their faces to the grounde.

{8:8} And they red in the boke of the lawe of God distinctly and planely, so that men vnderstode the thinge that was red.
{8:9} And Nehemias (which is Hathirsatha) and Esdras the prest and scrybe, and the Leuites yt caused the people to take hede, sayde vnto all the people: This daye is holy vnto the LORDE youre God: be not ye sory therfore, & wepe not. For all ye people wepte, wha they herde the wordes of the lawe.
{8:10} Therfore sayde he vnto them: Go youre waye, and eate the fat, and drynke the swete, and sende parte vnto them also that haue not prepared themselues: for this daye is holy vnto oure LORDE, be not ye sory therfore: for the ioye of the LORDE is youre strength.

{8:12} And all the people wente their waye to eate and drinke, and to sende parte vnto other, and to make greate myrth, for they had vnderstonde the wordes that were declared vnto them.
{8:13} And on the nexte daye were gathered together the chefe fathers amonge all the people, and the prestes and Leuites, vnto Esdras the scrybe, that he shulde teach them ye wordes of the lawe.
{8:14} And they founde written in the lawe, how that the LORDE had commaunded by Moses, that the childre of Israel shulde dwell in bothes in the feast of the seuenth moneth.
{8:15} And so they caused it be declared and proclamed in all their cities, & at Ierusalem, sayenge: Go vp vnto ye mout and fetch Olyue braunches, Pynebraunches, Myrtbraunches, Palmebraunches, & braunches of thicketrees, to make bothes as it is wrytten.
{8:16} And ye people wente vp, and fetched the, and made them bothes, euery one vpon the rofe of his house, and in their courtes, and in the courtes of the house of God, and in the strete by the Watergate, and in the strete by Ephraims porte.
{8:17} And all the congregacion of them that were come agayne out of the captyuite, made bothes, and dwelt therin: for sence the tyme of Iosua the sonne of Nu vnto this daye, had not the children of Israel done so, and there was very greate gladnesse.
{8:18} And euery daye from the first daie vnto the last, red he in the boke of the lawe of God. And seuen dayes helde they the feast, & on the eight daye the gatherynge together, acordynge vnto the maner.
{9:1} In the foure and twentieth daye of this moneth came the children of Israel together with fastinge and sack clothes, and earth vpon them,
{9:2} and separated the sede of Israel from all the straunge children, and stode and knowleged their synnes, and the wyckednesses of their fathers,
{9:3} and stode vp in their place, and red in the boke of the lawe of the LORDE their God foure tymes on the daye, and they knowleged, and worshipped the LORDE their God foure tymes on the daye.
{9:4} And the Leuites stode on hye, namely Iesua, Bani, Cadmiel, Sebania, Buni, Serebia, Bani, and Chenani, and cryed loude vnto the LORDE their God.
{9:5} And the Leuites, Iesua, Cadmiel, Bani, Hasabenia, Serebia, Hodia, Sebania, Pethahia, sayde: Stonde vp, prayse the LORDE oure God for euer: and let thankes be geue vnto the name of thy glorye, which excelleth all thankesgeuynge and prayse.
{9:6} LORDE, thou art alone, thou hast made heauen, and the heauen of all heauens, with all their hoost, the earth and all that therin is, the See and all that is therin: thou geuest life vnto all, and ye hoost of heauen bowe themselues vnto the.
{9:7} Thou art the LORDE God, that hast chosen Abra, and broughte him out of Vr in Chaldea, & called him Abraham,
{9:8} and founde his hert faithfull before the, and madest a couenaut with him, to geue vnto his sede the londe of the Cananites, Hethites, Amorites, Pheresites, Iebusites, and Girgosites, and hast made good thy wordes: for thou art righteous.
{9:9} And hast considered the mysery of oure fathers in Egipte, and herde their complainte by the reed See,
{9:10} and shewed tokes and wonders vpo Pharao, and on all his seruautes, and on all his people of his londe: for thou knewest yt they were presumptuous & cruell against them, & so madest thou the a name as it is this daie.
{9:11} And the reed See partedst thou in sunder before them, so that they wete thorow the myddes of the See drye shod: & their persecuters threwest thou in to the depe as a stone, in the mightie waters,
{9:12} and leddest them on the daye tyme in a cloudy pyler, and on the nighte season in a piler of fyre, to shewe them lighte in the waye yt they wente.
{9:13} Thou camest downe also vpo mount Sinai, and spakest vnto them from heauen, and gauest them righte iudgmentes, true lawes, good commaundementes and statutes,
{9:14} and declared vnto them thy holy Sabbath, and commaunded them preceptes, ordinaunces, and lawes, by Moses thy seruaunt:
{9:15} and gauest them bred from heauen whan they were hongrye, and broughte forth water for them out of the rock whan they were thyrstye: and promysed them, that they shulde go in, and take possession of the londe, where ouer thou haddest lyfte vp thine hande for to geue them.
{9:16} Neuertheles oure fathers were proude and hardnecked, so that they folowed not yi comaundementes,
{9:17} and refused to heare, and were not myndefull of the wonders yt thou dyddest for them: but became obstynate and heady, in so moch that they turned back to their bondage in their dishobedience. But thou my God forgauest, and wast gracious, mercifull, pacient, and of greate goodnesse, and forsokest them not.
{9:18} And though they made a molten calfe (and sayde: This is thy God, that broughte the out of the londe of Egipte) and dyd greate blasphemies,
{9:19} yet forsokest thou them not in the wyldernes, acordinge to thy greate mercy. And ye cloudy piler departed not from them on ye dayetyme to lede them the waye, nether the piler of fyre in the night season, to shewe them lighte in the waye that they wente.
{9:20} And thou gauest them thy good sprete to enfourme them, and withheldest not thy Manna from their mouth, and gauest the water wha they were thirstie.
{9:21} Fortye yeares longe madest thou prouysion for them in the wyldernesse, so that they wanted nothinge: their clothes waxed not olde, and their fete swelled not.
{9:22} And thou gauest the kigdomes & nacions, & partedst the acordinge to their porcions, so that they possessed the londe of Sihon kynge of Hesbon, & the londe of Og ye kynge of Basan.
{9:23} And their childre multiplyedst thou as the starres of heauen, and broughtest the in to the londe wherof thou haddest spoken vnto their fathers, that they shulde go in to it, and haue it in possession.
{9:24} And ye children wente in, and possessed the londe, and thou subdudest before the the inhabiters of the londe, euen the Cananites, & gauest them in to their hande, and their kynges and ye people of the londe, yt they might do with them what they wolde.
{9:25} And they wanne their stronge cities, & a fat londe, and toke possession of houses yt were full of all maner goodes, welles dygged out, vynyardes, oylgardens, & many frutefull trees: and they ate & were fylled, & became fat, & lyued in welth thorow thy greate goodnes.
{9:26} Neuertheles they were disobedient, and rebelled agaynst the, and cast thy lawe behynde their backes, and slewe thy prophetes (which exhorted them so earnestly, that they shulde couerte vnto the) and dyd greate blasphemies.
{9:27} Therfore gauest thou them ouer in to the hade of their enemies that vexed them. And in ye tyme of their trouble they cried vnto the, and thou hardest them from heauen: and thorow thy greate mercy thou gauest them sauiours, which helped the out of the hande of their enemies.
{9:28} But whan they came to rest, they turned back agayne to do euell before the: therfore leftest thou them in the hande of their enemies, so yt they had ye dominion ouer them. So they couerted, and cryed vnto the, and thou herdest them from heauen, and many a tyme hast thou delyuered them acordinge to yi greate mercy,
{9:29} and testified vnto them, that they shulde turne agayne vnto thy lawe. Notwithstodinge they were proude, and herkened not vnto thy comaundementes, but synned in thy lawes (which a man shulde do, & lyue in them) & turned their shulder awaye, & were styffnecked, & wolde not heare.
{9:30} And many yeares dyddest thou forbeare them, & testified vnto them thorow yi sprete, euen by the office of yi prophetes, & yet wolde they not heare. Therfore gauest thou the in to ye hade of ye nacions in the londes.
{9:31} But for thy greate mercies sake thou hast not vtterly cosumed them, nether forsaken them: for thou art a gracious and mercifull God.
{9:32} Now oure God, thou greate God, mightie and terrible, thou that kepest couenaunt and mercy, regarde not a litle all the trauayle yt hath happened vnto vs, & oure kynges, prynces, prestes, prophetes, fathers & all thy people, sence the tyme of the kynges of Assur vnto this daie.
{9:33} Thou art righteous in all yt thou hast broughte vpo vs: for thou hast done righte.
{9:34} As for vs, we haue bene vngodly, and or kynges, prynces, prestes & fathers haue not done after yi lawe, ner regarded yi comaundementes, & thy earnest exhortacios wherwith thou hast exhorted them,
{9:35} & haue not serued ye in their kyngdome, and in thy greate goodes yt thou gauest them, and in the large and plenteous lode which thou gauest them to good, and haue not conuerted from their wicked workes.
{9:36} Beholde, therfore are we in bondage this daye: Yee euen in the lode that thou gauest vnto oure fathers, to enioye the frutes and goodes therof, beholde, there are we bondmen.
{9:37} And greate is the increase of it vnto the kynges, whom thou hast set ouer vs because of oure synnes, and they haue dominion ouer oure bodies and catell, and we are in greate trouble.
{9:38} And in all this made we a sure couenaunt, & wrote it, & let or prynces, Leuites & prestes seale it.

{12:27} And in the dedicacion of the wall at Ierusalem, were the Leuites soughte out of all their places, that they mighte be broughte to Ierusalem, to kepe ye dedicacion in gladnesse, with thankesgeuynges, with synginge, with Cymbales, Psalteries and harpes.
{12:28} And the children of the syngers gathered the selues together from the playne countre aboute Ierusalem, and from the vyllages of Nethophathi,
{12:29} and from the house of Gilgal, & out of the feldes of Gibea & Asmaueth: for ye syngers had buylded them vyllages aboute Ierusalem.
{12:30} And ye prestes and Leuites purified them selues, and clensed the people, the gates and the wall.
{12:31} And I caused the prynces to go vp vpon the wall, and appoynted two greate queres of thankesgeuynge, which wete on the righte hande of the wall towarde the Donggate,
{12:32} and after them wete Hosaia, and halfe of the prynces of Iuda,
{12:33} & Asaria, Esdras, Mesullam,
{12:34} Iuda, Ben Iamin, Semaia and Ieremy:
{12:35} and certayne of the prestes childre wt trompettes, namely Zachary ye sonne of Ionathan, the sonne of Semaia, the sonne of Mathania, the sonne of Michaia, the sonne of Sachur, the sonne of Assaph,
{12:36} and his brethren, Semaia, Asareel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nathaneel and Iuda and Hanani, with the musicall instrumentes of Dauid ye man of God. And Esdras ye scrybe before the
{12:37} towarde the Wellgate, and they wente vp ouer agaynst them vpon the steppes of the cite of Dauid at the goynge vp of the wall to the house of Dauid, vnto the Watergate Eastwarde.
{12:38} The other quere of thankesgeuynge wente ouer against them, and I after them, and the halfe parte of the people vpon ye wall, towarde ye Fornacegate vpwarde, vntyll ye brode wall,
{12:39} and to ye porte of Ephraim, and to the Oldgate, and to ye Fyshgate, and to the tower of Hananeel, and to the tower of Meah, vntyll the Shepegate. And in ye presongate stode they styll,
{12:40} and so stode the two queres of thankesgeuynge of the house of God, and I and the halfe of the rulers with me,
{12:41} and the prestes, namely Eliachim, Maeseia, Miniamin, Michaia, Elioenai, Zachary, Hanania, with tropettes,
{12:42} and Maeseia, Semaia, Eleasar, Vsi, Iohanan, Malchia, Elam and Aser. And the syngers songe loude, and Iesrahia was the ouerseer.
{12:43} And the same daye were there greate sacrifices offred, & they reioysed: for God had geue them greate gladnesse, so that both the wyues and children were ioyfull, & the myrth of Ierusalem was herde farre of.
{12:44} At the same tyme were there men appoynted ouer the treasure chestes (wherin were ye Heueofferynges, the firstlinges and the tithes) that they shulde gather them out of ye feldes aboute the cities, to destribute the vnto the prestes and Leuites acordinge to the lawe: for Iuda was glad of the prestes, and Leuites, that they stode and wayted
{12:45} vpon the office of their God, and the office of the purificacion. And the syngers & porters stode after the commaundemet of Dauid & of Salomon his sonne:
{12:46} for in the tyme of Dauid and Assaph, were the chefe syngers founded, and the songes of prayse and thankesgeuynge vnto God.
{12:47} In the tyme of Zorobabel and Nehemias, dyd all Israel geue porcios vnto the syngers and porters, euery daye his porcion, and they gaue thinges halowed vnto the Leuites, and the Leuites gaue thinges that were sanctified, vnto the childre of Aaron.
{13:1} And what tyme as the boke of Moses was red in ye eares of the people, there was founde wrytten therin, yt the Ammonites and Moabites shulde neuer come in to the congregacion of God,
{13:2} because they mett not the children of Israel wt bred and water, and hyred Balaam against the, that he shulde curse them: neuertheles oure God turned ye curse in to a blessynge.
{13:3} Now whan they herde the lawe, they separated from Israel euery one that had myxte him selfe therin.
{13:4} And before this had the prest Eliasib delyuered the chest of ye house of oure God vnto his kynsman Tobia:
{13:5} for he had made him a greate chest, and there had they aforetyme layed the meatofferynges, frankencense, vessell, and the tithes of corne, wyne and oyle (acordinge to the commaundement geuen to the Leuites, syngers and porters) and the Heueofferynges of the prestes.
{13:6} But in all this was not I at Ierusalem: for in ye two and thirtieth yeare of Artaxerses kynge of Babilon, came I vnto the kynge, and after certayne dayes optayned I lycence of the kynge
{13:7} to come to Ierusale. And I gat knowlege of ye euell that Eliasib dyd vnto Tobia, in that he had made him a chest in the courte of the house of God,
{13:8} and it greued me sore, and I cast forth all the vessels of Tobias house out of the chest,
{13:9} and commauded them to clense the chest. And thither broughte I agayne the vessels of the house of God, the meatofferynge and the incense.
{13:10} And I perceaued, that the porcions of ye Leuites were not geuen them, for the which cause the Leuites and syngers were fled, euery one to his londe for to worke.
{13:11} Then reproued I the rulers, and sayde: Why forsake we the house of God? But I gathered them together, and set them in their place.
{13:12} Then brought all Iuda the tithes of corne, wyne and oyle vnto the treasure.
{13:13} And I made treasurers ouer ye treasure, euen Selemia ye prest, and Sadoc the scrybe, & of the Leuites Pedaia, and vnder their hande Hanan the sonne of Sachur the sonne of Mathania: for they were counted faithfull, and their office was, to destribute vnto their brethren.
{13:14} Thynke vpon me O my God here in, & wype not out my mercy, that I haue shewed on ye house of my God, & on the offices therof.
{13:15} At the same tyme sawe I some tredinge wyne presses on the Sabbath, and brynginge in clusters, and asses laden wyth wyne, grapes, fygges, and brynginge all maner of burthens vnto Ierusalem, vpon the Sabbath daye. And I rebuked them earnestly ye same daye that they solde ye vytayles.
{13:16} There dwelt me of Tyre also therin, which broughte fysh and all maner of ware, and solde on the Sabbath vnto the childre of Iuda and Ierusalem.
{13:17} Then reproued I the rulers in Iuda, and saide vnto them: What euell thinge is this that ye do, and breake the Sabbath daye?
{13:18} Dyd not oure fathers euen thus, and oure God broughte all this plage vpon vs & vpon this cite? And ye make the wrath more yet vpon Israel, in that ye breake the Sabbath.
{13:19} And whan the portes of Ierusalem were drawen vp before the Sabbath, I commauded to shutt the gates, and charged that they shulde not be opened tyll after the Sabbath: and some of my seruauntes set I at the gates, yt there shulde no burthe be broughte in on the Sabbath daye.
{13:20} Then remayned the chapmen and marchauntes once or twyce ouer nighte without Ierusalem with all maner of wares.
{13:21} Then reproued I them sore, & sayde vnto them: Why tary ye all night aboute the wall? Yf ye do it once agayne, I wil laye handes vpon you. From that tyme forth came they nomore on the Sabbath.
{13:22} And I sayde vnto the Leuites which were cleane, that they shulde come and kepe the gates, to halowe the Sabbath daye. Thynke vpo me (O my God) cocernynge this also, & spare me acordynge to thy greate mercy.
{13:23} And at the same tyme sawe I Iewes, that maried wyues of Asdod, Ammon and of Moab,
{13:24} and their children spake halfe in the speache of Asdod, and coulde not speake in ye Iewish language, but by ye tonge mighte a ma perceaue euery people.
{13:25} And I reproued them, and cursed them, & smote certayne men of the, and plucte them vp, and toke an ooth of them by God: Ye shal not geue youre daughters vnto their sonnes, nether shal ye take their daughters vnto youre sonnes, or for youre selues.
{13:26} Dyd not Salomon ye kynge of Israel synne ther in? & yet amonge many Heythen was there no kynge like him, & he was deare vnto his God, and God made him kynge ouer all Israel, and the outlandish wemen.
{13:27} KJV: Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?
{13:28} And one of the children of Ioiada the sonne of Eliasib ye hye prest, had made a cotracte wyth Saneballath the Horonite: but I chaced him fro me.
{13:29} O my God, thynke thou vpon them that are quyte of the presthode, and haue desyled the couenaunt of the presthode and of the Leuites.
{13:30} Thus clensed I them from all soch as were outlandish, and appoynted the courses of the prestes and Leuites, euery one to his office,
{13:31} and to offre the wod at tymes appoynted, and the first frutes. Thynke thou vpon me (O my God) for the best.

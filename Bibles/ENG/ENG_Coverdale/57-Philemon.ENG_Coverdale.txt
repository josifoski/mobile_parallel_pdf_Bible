{1:1} Paul the presoner of Iesu Christ, and brother Timotheus. Vnto Philemon the beloued, and oure helper,
{1:2} and to the beloued Appia, and to Archippus or felowe soudyer, and to the congregacion in thy house.
{1:3} Grace be with you, and peace from God oure father and from the LORDE Iesus Christ.
{1:4} I thanke my God, makynge mencion allwayes of the in my prayers
{1:5} (for so moch as I heare of thy loue and faith which thou hast on the LORDE Iesu, and towarde all sayntes)
{1:6} that oure comen faith maye be frutefull in the, thorow knowlege of all ye good that ye haue in Christ Iesu.
{1:7} Greate ioye and consolacion haue I in thy loue. For by the (brother) the sayntes are hertely refresshed.
{1:8} Wherfore though I haue great boldnes in Christ to commaunde the that which becommeth the,
{1:9} yet for loues sake I rather beseke ye, though I be as I am, eue Paul aged, and now a presoner also of Iesu Christ.
{1:10} I beseke the for my sonne Onesimus (whom I haue begotten in my bondes)
{1:11} which in tyme past was to the vnprofitable, but now profitable both to the and me.
{1:12} Whom I haue sent agayne: but receaue thou him (that is) euen myne awne hert.
{1:13} For I wolde haue kepte him styll with me, that in thy steade he might haue mynistred vnto me in ye bondes of ye Gospell:
{1:14} Neuertheles without thy mynde wolde I do nothinge, that ye good which thou doest, shulde not be of compulsion, but wyllingly.
{1:15} Happly he therfore departed for a season, that thou shuldest receaue him for euer:
{1:16} not now as a seruaunt, but aboue a seruaunt, euen a brother beloued, specially to me, but how moch more vnto ye, both in ye flesh and in the LORDE?
{1:17} Yf thou holde me for thy companyon, receaue him then euen as my selfe.
{1:18} But yf he haue hurte the, or oweth the oughte, that laye to my charge.
{1:19} I Paul haue wrytten it with myne awne hande. I wil recompence it: so that I do not saye vnto ye, how that thou owest vnto me euen thine owne selfe.
{1:20} Euen so brother, let me enioye the in the LORDE: refresh thou my hert in the LORDE.
{1:21} Trustinge in thine obediece, I haue wrytten vnto the, for I knowe that thou wilt do more then I saye.
{1:22} Morouer prepare me lodginge, for I hope that thorow youre prayers I shalbe geuen vnto you.
{1:23} There saluteth the, Epaphras my felowe presoner in Christ Iesu,
{1:24} Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my helpers.
{1:25} The grace of oure LORDE Iesu Christ be with youre sprete, Amen.

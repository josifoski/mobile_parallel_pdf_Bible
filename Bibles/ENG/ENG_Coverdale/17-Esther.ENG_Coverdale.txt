{1:1} In the tyme of Ahasuerus, which reigned from India vnto Ethiopia, ouer an hundreth and seuen and twentye londes,
{1:2} what tyme as he sat on his seate roiall in the castell of Susan
{1:3} in the thirde yeare of his reigne, he made a feast vnto all his prynces and seruauntes, namely vnto the mightie men of Persia and Media, to the Debities and rulers of his countrees,
{1:4} that he mighte shewe the noble riches of his kingdome, and the glorious worshippe of his greatnesse, many dayes longe, euen an hundreth and foure score dayes.
{1:5} And whan these dayes were expyred, the kynge made a feast vnto all the people that were in the castell of Susan, both vnto greate and small, seuen dayes longe in the courte of the garden by the kynges palace:
{1:6} where there hanged whyte, reed & yalow clothes, fastened with coardes of lynnen and scarlet in siluer rynges, vpon pylers of Marble stone. The benches were of golde and siluer made vpon a pauement of grene, white, yalowe and black Marble.
{1:7} And ye drinke was caried in vessels of golde, and there was euer chaunge of vessell. And the kinges wine was moch acordynge to the power of the kynge.
{1:8} And no man was appoynted what he shulde drinke: for the kynge had commaunded all the officers of his house, that euery one shulde do as it lyked him.
{1:9} And the quene Vasthi made a feast also for the wemen in the palace of Ahasuerus.
{1:10} And on the seuenth daye whan the kynge was mery of the wine, he comaunded Mehuman, Bistha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Sethar and Charcas, the seuen chamberlaynes (that dyd seruyce in the presence of kynge Ahasuerus)
{1:11} to fetch the quene Vasthi with the crowne regall, that he might shewe ye people and prynces hir fairnesse: for she was bewtifull.
{1:12} But the quene Vasthi wolde not come at the kynges worde by his chamberlaynes. Then was the kynge very wroth, and his indignacio kyndled in him.
{1:13} And the kynge spake to ye wyse men that had vnderstondinge in the ordinaunces of the londe (for the kinges matters must be hadled before all soch as haue knowlege of the lawe and iudgment:
{1:14} And the nexte vnto him were, Charsena, Sethar, Admatha, Tharsis, Meres, Marsena and Memuchan, the seuen prynces of the Persias, and Meedes, which sawe the kynges face, and satt aboue in the kyngdome)
{1:15} What lawe shulde be execute vpon the quene Vasthi, because she dyd not acordynge to the worde of the kynge by his chamberlaines.
{1:16} The saide Memucha before the kynge & the prynces: The quene Vasthi hath not onely done euell agaynst the kinge but also agaynst all the prynces and all the people in all the londes of kynge Ahasuerus
{1:17} for this dede of the quene shall come abrode vnto all wemen, so that they shall despyse their husbandes before their eyes, and shall saye: The kynge Ahasuers comaunded Vasthi ye quene to come before him, but she wolde not.
{1:18} And so shall the pryncesses in Persia and Media saye lykewyse vnto all the kynges prynces, whan they heare of this dede of the quene, thus shall there aryse despytefulnes and wrath ynough.
{1:19} Yf it please the kynge, let there go a kyngly commaundemet from him, and let it be wrytten acordynge to the lawe of the Persians and Medians (and not to be transgressed) that Vasthi come nomore before kynge Ahasuerus, and let the kynge geue the kyngdome vnto another that is better then she.
{1:20} And yt this wrytinge of the kynge which shalbe made, be published thorow out all his empyre (which is greate) that all wyues maye holde their husbandes in honoure, both amonge greate and smal.
{1:21} This pleased the kynge and the prynces, and the kynge dyd acordynge to the worde of Memuchan.
{1:22} Then were there letters sent forth in to all the kynges londes, in to euery londe acordinge to the wrytinge ther of, and to euery people after their laguage, yt euery man shulde be lorde in his awne house. And this caused he be spoken after the language of his people.
{2:1} After these actes whan the displeasure of kynge Ahasuerus was layed, he thoughte vpon Vasthi, what she had done, and what was concluded concernynge her.
{2:2} Then sayde the kynges seruauntes: Let there be fayre yonge virgins soughte for the kynge,
{2:3} and let the kynge appoynte ouerseers in all ye londes of his empyre, that they maye brynge together all fayre yonge virgins vnto the castel of Susan to the Wemens buyldinge, vnder the hande of Hegai the kynges clamberlayne, that kepeth the wemen, and let him geue them their apparell.
{2:4} And loke which damsell pleaseth the kynge, let her be quene in Vasthis steade. This pleased the kynge, and he dyd so.
{2:5} In the castell of Susan there was a Iewe, whose name was Mardocheus, the sonne of Iair, the sonne of Simei, the sonne of Cis, the sonne of Iemini,
{2:6} which was caried awaye from Ierusalem, whan Iechonias the kynge of Iuda was led awaye, (whom Nabuchodonosor the kynge of Babilon caried awaye)
{2:7} and he norished Hadassa (that is Hester) his vncles danghter: for she had nether father ner mother, and she was a fayre and beutyfull damsell. And whan hir father and mother dyed, Mardocheus receaued her as his awne daughter.
{2:8} Now whan ye kynges comaundemet and comyssion was published, & many dasels were broughte together vnto the castell of Susan vnder ye hande of Hegai, Hester, was take also vnto ye kynges house vnder ye hande of Hegai ye keper of ye weme,
{2:9} & the damsell pleased him, & she founde grace in his sighte. And he put her wt hir maydes in ye best place of ye Womes buildige.
{2:10} And Hester shewed it not vnto hir people & hir kynred: for Mardocheus had charged her, yt she shulde not tell it.
{2:11} And Mardocheus walked euery daye before ye courte of ye Womes buyldinge, yt he might knowe how Hester dyd, and what shulde become of her.
{2:12} And whan the appoynted tyme of euery damsell came that she shulde come to ye kynge Ahasuerus, after that she had bene twolue monethes in the deckynge of the wemen (for their deckynge must haue so moch tyme, namely sixe monethes with Balme & Myrre, & sixe monethes wt good spyces, so were the weme beutifyed)
{2:13} then wente there one damsell vnto ye kynge, and what so euer she requyred, yt must be geue her to go wt her out of the Womens buyldinge vnto ye kynges palace.
{2:14} And whan one came in the euenynge, ye same wete fro him on ye morow in to ye seconde house of wemen, vnder the hande of Saasgas the kynges chamberlayne, which kepte ye concubines. And she must come vnto the kynge nomore, excepte it pleased the kynge, and that he caused her to be called by name.
{2:15} Now whan the tyme came of Hester the daughter of Abihail Mardocheus vncle (whom he had receaued as his awne daughter) yt she shulde come to the kynge, she desyred nothinge but what Hegai the kynges chamberlayne the keper of the wemen sayde. And Hester founde fauoure in the sighte of all them that loked vpon her.
{2:16} And Hester was taken vnto kynge Ahasuerus in to the house royall, in the tenth moneth which is called Tebeth, in the seuenthe yeare of his reigne.
{2:17} And the kynge loued Hester aboue all the wemen, and she founde grace and mercy in his sighte before all the virgins: and he set the quenes croune vpon hir heade, and made her quene in steade of Vasthi.
{2:18} And the kynke made a greate feast vnto all his prynces and seruauntes (which feast was because of Hester) and let the londes be in quyetnes, & gaue royall giftes.
{2:19} And whan the virgins were gathered together the seconde tyme, Mardocheus sat in the kynges gate.
{2:20} And as yet had not Hester shewed hir kynred and hir people, acordinge as Mardocheus had bydden her: for Hester dyd after the worde of Mardocheus, like as whan he was hir tutoure.
{2:21} At the same tyme whyle Mardocheus sat in the kynges gate, two of the kinges chamberlaynes, Bigthan and Theres which kepte the dore, were wroth, and sought to laye their handes on the kynge Ahasuerus:
{2:22} Wherof Mardocheus gat knowlege, and tolde it vnto quene Hester, and Hester certified the kynge therof in Mardocheus name.
{2:23} And whan inquisicion was made, it was founde so. And they were both hanged on tre: and it was wrytte in the Cronicles before the kynge.
{3:1} After these actes dyd the kynge promote Aman the sonne of Amadathi the Agagite, vnd set him hye, & set his seate aboue all ye prynces that were with him.
{3:2} And all the kynges seruauntes that were in the gate, bowed their knees, and dyd reuerence vnto Aman: for the kinge had so comaunded. But Mardocheus bowed not the knee, and worshipped him not.
{3:3} Then the kynges seruauntes which were in the kynges gate, sayde vnto Mardocheus: Why transgressest thou the kynges commaundement?
{3:4} And whan they spake this daylie vnto him, and he folowed them not, they tolde Aman, that they mighte se whether Mardocheus matters wolde endure: for he had tolde them, yt he was a Iewe.
{3:5} And wha Aman sawe, that Mardocheus bowed not the knee vnto him, ner worshipped him, he was full of indignacion & despyte,
{3:6} that he shulde laye hondes onely on Mardocheus: for they had shewed him ye people of Mardocheus, but he sought to destroye the people of Mardocheus, and all the people that were in the whole empyre of Ahasuerus.
{3:7} In the first moneth that is the moneth Nissan, in ye twolueth yeare of kinge Ahasuerus, was there occasion and oportunyte sought by Aman, from one daye to another, and from the same moneth vnto the twolueth moneth, that is the moneth Adar.
{3:8} And Ama sayde vnto kinge Ahasuerus: There is a people scatered abrode and dispersed amonge all people in all the londes of thine empire, and their lawe is cotrary vnto all people, and they do not after the kynges lawes, nether is it the kinges profit to suffre the after this maner.
{3:9} Yf it please the kynge, let him wryte, that they maye be destroyed, & so wil I weye downe ten thousande talentes of siluer, vnder the handes of the workmen, to be brought in to the kynges chamber.
{3:10} Then toke the kynge his rynge from his hande, and gaue it vnto Aman the sonne of Amadathi the Agagite the Iewes enemie.
{3:11} And the kinge sayde vnto Aman: Let the siluer be geuen the, and that people also, to do withall what pleaseth the.
{3:12} Then were the kynges scrybes called on ye thirtenth daye of the first moneth, & there was wrytten (acordynge as Aman commauded) vnto the kynges prynces, and to the Debites euery where in the londes, and to the captaynes of euery people in the countrees on euery syde, acordynge to the wrytinge of euery nacion, and after their language in the name of kynge Ahasuerus, and sealed with the kynges rynge.
{3:13} And the wrytynges were sent by postes in to all the kynges lodes, to rote out, to kyll, and to destroye all Iewes, both yonge and olde, childre and wemen in one daye (namely vpon the thirtenth daye of the twolueth moneth, which is the moneth Adar) and to spoyle their goodes.
{3:14} This was the summe of the wrytinge, yt there shulde be a commaundement geuen in all londes, to be published vnto all people, yt they shulde be ready agaynst the same daye.
{3:15} And the postes wente in all the haist acordynge to the kynges commaundement. And in the castell of Susan was the comaundement deuysed. And the kynge & Aman sat & dranke. But ye cite of Susan was disquieted.
{4:1} Whan Mardocheus perceaued all that was done, he rete his clothes, and put on a sack cloth, & asshes, & wente out in to the myddes of the cite, and cried loude and lamentably,
{4:2} and came before the kynges gate: for there might no man entre within the kynges gate, that had a sack cloth on.
{4:3} And in all lodes & places, as farre as the kynges worde and commaundement extended, there was greate lamentacion amonge the Iewes, and many fasted, wepte, mourned, & laye in sack clothes & in asshes.
{4:4} So Hesters dasels, and hir chamberlaines, came and tolde it her. Then was the quene exceadingly astonnyed. And she sent rayment, that Mardocheus shulde put them on, and laye the sacklothe from him. But Mardocheus wolde not take them.
{4:5} The called Hester Hathac one of the kinges chamberlaines (which stode before her) and gaue him a comaundement vnto Mardocheus, that he might knowe what it were, and wherfore he dyd so.
{4:6} So Hathac wente forth to Mardocheus vnto the strete of the cite, which was before the kynges gate.
{4:7} And Mardocheus tolde him of all yt had happened vnto him, and of the summe of siluer that Ama had promysed to weie downe in the kynges chamber because of ye Iewes for to destroye them,
{4:8} and he gaue him the copye of the commaundement, that was deuysed at Susan to destroye them, that he mighte shewe it vnto Hester, and to speake to her and charge her, yt she shulde go into the kynge, and make her prayer and supplicacion vnto him for hir people.
{4:9} And wha Hathat came in, and tolde Hester the wordes of Mardocheus,
{4:10} Hester spake vnto Hathat, and comaunded him to saye vnto Mardocheus:
{4:11} All the kynges seruauntes, and the people in the londes of the kynge knowe, that who so euer commeth within the courte vnto ye kynge, whether it be man or woman, which is not called, the comaundement is that the same shal dye immediatly, excepte the kynge holde out the golde cepter vnto him, that he maye lyue. As for me, I haue not bene called to come in to the kynge now this thirtie dayes.
{4:12} And wha Mardocheus was certified of Hesters wordes,
{4:13} Mardocheus bad saie againe vnto Hester: Thynke not to saue thine awne life, whyle thou art in ye kynges house before all Iewes:
{4:14} for yf thou holdest thy peace at this tyme, then shal the Iewes haue helpe and delyueraunce out of another place, & thou & thy fathers house shalbe destroyed. And who knoweth whether thou art come to the kyngdome, for this tymes sake?
{4:15} Hester bad geue Mardocheus this answere:
{4:16} Go thou yi waye then, & gather together all ye Iewes yt are founde at Susan, & fast ye for me, yt ye eate not & drynke not in thre dayes, nether daye ner nighte. I & my damsels wil fast likewyse, & so wyl I go into the kynge cotrary to the comaundement: yf I perishe, I perishe.
{4:17} So Mardocheus wente his waye, & dyd all yt Hester had comaunded him.
{5:1} And on the thirde daye put Hester on hir royall apparell, and stode in the courte of ye kinges palace within ouer agaynst the kynges house. And ye kynge sat vpo his royall seate in ye kynges palace ouer agaynst ye dore of the house.
{5:2} And whan the kynge sawe Hester the quene stodinge in the courte, she founde grace in his sighte. And ye kynge helde out the golde cepter in his hade towarde Hester. So Hester stepte forth, and touched the toppe of ye cepter.
{5:3} Then sayde ye kynge vnto her: What wilt thou quene Hester? & what requyrest thou? axe eue the halfe of ye empyre, & it shal be geue the.
{5:4} Hester sayde: Yf it please ye kynge, let ye kynge & Aman come this daye vnto ye banket yt I haue prepared.
{5:5} The kynge sayde: Cause Aman to make haist, yt he maye do as Hester hath saide. Now wha the kynge & Aman came to ye banket yt Hester had prepared,
{5:6} the kynge sayde vnto Hester whan he had dronken wyne: Hester, what is thy peticion? it shal be geue the. And what requyrest thou? euen the halfe of the empyre, it shal be done.
{5:7} Then answered Hester and sayde: My peticion and desire is,
{5:8} yf I haue founde grace in ye sight of the kynge, & yf it please the kinge to geue me my peticion, and to fulfill my request, then let the kynge & Aman come to the bancket yt I shal prepare for the, and so wil I do tomorow as the kynge hath sayde.
{5:9} Then wente Aman forth the same daye ioyfull and mery in his mynde. And whan he sawe Mardocheus in the kynges gate, yt he stode not vp and kneled before him, he was full of indignacion at Mardocheus.
{5:10} Neuertheles he refrained himselfe: and wha he came home, he sent, and called for his fredes, and Seres his wyfe,
{5:11} and tolde them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, all together how the kynge had promoted him so greatly, and how that he was taken aboue the prynces and seruauntes of the kynge.
{5:12} Aman sayde morouer: Yee and Hester the quene let no man come with the kynge vnto the bancket that she had prepared, excepte me, and tomorow am I bidden vnto her also with the kynge.
{5:13} But in all this am I not satisfied as longe as I se Mardocheus the Iewe syttinge in ye kynges gate.
{5:14} Then sayde Seres his wife and all his frendes vnto him: Let the make a galowe of fiftye cubites hie, & tomorow speake thou vnto the kynge, that Mardocheus maye be hanged theron, yf thou comest merely with the kynge vnto the bancket. Aman was well content withall, and caused a galowe to be prepared.
{6:1} The same night coulde not the kynge slepe, and he commaunded to brynge ye Chronicles and storyes: which wha they were red before ye kinge,
{6:2} they happened on the place where it was wrytte, how Mardocheus had tolde, that the kynges two chaberlaynes (which kepte ye tresholdes) sought to laie hondes on kinge Ahasuerus.
{6:3} And the kynge saide: What worshippe and good haue we done to Mardocheus therfore? Then sayde the kynges seruauntes that mynistred vnto him. There is nothinge done for him.
{6:4} And the kynge sayde: Who is in ye courte? (for Aman was gone in to ye courte without before ye kinges house, yt he might speake vnto ye kinge to hange Mardocheus on ye tre, yt he had prepared for him.)
{6:5} And the kinges seruauntes saide vnto him: Beholde, Ama stodeth in the courte. The kynge saide: Let him come in.
{6:6} And wha Ama came in, ye kinge saide vnto him: What shal be done vnto ye ma, whom the kynge wolde fayne brynge vnto worshippe? But Hama thought in his hert: Whom shulde the kynge els be glad to brynge vnto worshippe, but me?
{6:7} And Aman sayde vnto the kynge: Let the man vnto whom the kynge wolde be glad to do worshippe, be broughte hither,
{6:8} that he maye be araied with the royall garmentes which the kynge vseth to weere: and the horse that the kynge rydeth vpon, and that the crowne royall maye be set vpon his heade.
{6:9} And let this rayment and horse be delyuered vnder the hande of one of the kynges prynces, that he maye araye the man withall (whom the kynge wolde fayne honoure) and cary him vpon the horse thorow the strete of the cite, and cause it to be proclamed before him: Thus shal it be done to euery man, whom the kynge wolde fayne honoure.
{6:10} The kynge sayde: Make haist, and take (as thou hast sayde) the raymet and the horse, and do euen so with Mardocheus ye Iewe that sitteth before the kynges gate, and let nothinge fayle of all that thou hast spoken.
{6:11} Then toke Aman the rayment and the horse, and arayed him, and broughte him on horsbacke thorow the strete of the cite, and proclamed before him: Euen thus shall it be done vnto euery man whom the kynge is disposed to honoure.
{6:12} And Mardocheus came agayne to the kynges gate, but Aman gat him home in all the haist, mournynge with bare heade,
{6:13} and tolde Seres his wyfe and all his frendes, euery thynge that had happened him. Then sayde his wise men and Seres his wyfe vnto him: Yf it be Mardocheus of the sede of the Iewes, before who thou hast begonne to fall, thou canst do nothynge vnto him, but shalt fall before him.
{6:14} Whyle they were yet talkynge with him, came the kynges chamberlaynes, and caused Aman to make haist to come vnto the bancket that Hester had prepared.
{7:1} And whan the kynge and Aman came to the bancket that quene Hester had prepared,
{7:2} the kynge sayde vnto Hester on the seconde daye whan he had droken wyne: What is thy peticion quene Hester, that it maye be geuen the? And what requyrest thou? Yee axe euen halfe of the empyre, and it shal be done.
{7:3} Hester ye quene answered and sayde: Yf I haue founde grace in thy sighte (O kynge) and yf it please the kynge, then graunte me my lyfe at my desyre and my people for my peticions sake:
{7:4} for we are solde to be destroyed, to be slayne, and to perishe. And wolde God we were solde to be bondmen and bondwemen, then wolde I holde my tonge, so shulde not the enemye be so hye to the kynges harme.
{7:5} The kynge Ahasuerus spake & saide vnto quene Hester: What is he that? Or where is he yt darre presume in his mynde to do soch a thinge after that maner?
{7:6} Hester sayde: The enemye and aduersary is this wicked Aman. As for Ama, he was exceadingly afraied before ye kynge & ye quene.
{7:7} And the kynge arose fro the bancket & fro ye wyne in his displeasure, and wente in to the palace garden. And Aman stode vp, and besoughte quene Hester for his life: for he sawe yt there was a mischauce prepared for him of the kynge allready.
{7:8} And whan the kynge came agayne out of the palace garden in to ye parler where they had eaten, Aman had layed him vpon the bed that Hester sat vpon. Then saide the kinge: wyl he force the quene also besyde me in the house? As soone as that worde wente out of the kynges mouth, they couered Amans face.
{7:9} And Harbona one of the chamberlaynes that stode before the kynge, sayde Beholde, there stondeth a galowe in Amas house fiftie cubytes hye, which he had made for Mardocheus, that spake good for ye kinge. The kynge sayde: Hange him theron.
{7:10} So they hanged Aman on the galowe that he had made for Mardocheus. Then was the kynges wrath stylled.
{8:1} The same daye dyd kynge Ahasuerus geue the house of Aman the Iewes enemye, vnto quene Hester. And Mardocheus came before ye kinge: for Hester tolde how that he beloged vnto her.
{8:2} And the kynge put of his fynger rynge, which he had taken from Aman, & gaue it vnto Mardocheus. And Hester set Mardocheus ouer the house of Aman.
{8:3} And Hester spake yet more before the kynge, and fell downe at his fete, & besought him, that he wolde put awaye the wyckednes of Aman the Agagite, and his deuice that he had ymagined against ye Iewes.
{8:4} And the kynge helde out the golden cepter vnto Hester. Then rose Hester, and stode before the kynge,
{8:5} and sayde: Yf it please the kynge, and yf I haue foude grace in his sight, & yf it be couenyent for the kinge, and yf it be accepted in his sighte, then let it be wrytte, yt the letters of the deuyce of Ama the sonne of Amadathai the Agagite, maie be called agayne: which letters he wrote, to destroie ye Iewes in all ye kynges lodes.
{8:6} For how can I se the euell that shal happe vnto my people? and how can I loke vpon the destruction of my kynred?
{8:7} Then sayde ye kynge Ahasuerus vnto quene Hester, and to Mardocheus the Iewe: Beholde, I haue geuen Hester the house of Aman, & him haue they hanged vpon a tre, because he layed hade vpon ye Iewes.
{8:8} Wryte ye now therfore for the Iewes, as it liketh you in the kynges name, and seale it with ye kynges rynge (for the wrytinges that were wrytten in ye kynges name, and sealed with the kynges rynge, durst no man dysanulle.)
{8:9} Then were the kynges scrybes called at the same tyme in the thirde moneth, that is the moneth Siuan, on the thre & twentieth daie. And it was wrytten (as Mardocheus comaunded) vnto the Iewes and to the prynces, to the Debities and captaynes in the londes from India vntyll Ethiopia, namely, an hundreth and seuen and twentye londes, vnto euery one acordinge to the wrytinge therof, vnto euery people after their speche, and to the Iewes acordinge to their wrytinge and language.
{8:10} And it was written in the kynge Ahasuerus name, and sealed with the kynges rynge. And by postes that rode vpon swyfte yonge Mules, sent he the wrytinges,
{8:11} wher in the kynge graunted the Iewes (in what cities so euer they were) to gather them selues together, and to stonde for their lyfe, and for to rote out, to slaye, and to destroye all the power of the people and londe that wolde trouble them, with children and wemen, and to spoyle their good
{8:12} vpon one daye in all the londes of kynge Ahasuerus, namely vpon the thirtenth daye of the twolueth moneth, which is the moneth Adar.
{8:13} The summe of the wrytinge was, how there was a comaundement geuen in all londes to be publisled vnto all the people, that ye Iewes shulde be ready agaynst that daye to auenge them selues on their enemies.
{8:14} And the postes that rode vpon the Mules, made haistwith all spede, acordinge to the kynges worde: and the commaundement was deuysed in the castel of Susan.
{8:15} As for Mardocheus, he wente out from the kynge in royall apparell of yalow and whyte, and wyth a greate crowne of golde, beynge arayed with a garment of linnen and purple, and ye cite of Susan reioysed & was glad:
{8:16} but vnto the Iewes there was come light and gladnesse, & ioye & worshippe.
{8:17} And in all londes and cities, in to what places so euer the kynges worde and commaundemet reached, there was ioye & myrth, prosperite and good dayes amonge the Iewes: in so moch that many of the people in the londe became of the Iewes beleue, for the feare of the Iewes came vpon them.
{9:1} In the twolueth moneth, that is the moneth Adar, vpon the thyrtenth daye, which the kinges worde and comaundement had appoynted, that it shulde be done, eue vpon ye same daie yt the enemies shulde haue destroyed the Iewes to haue oppressed them, it turned contrary wise, euen yt the Iewes shulde subdue their enemies.
{9:2} Then gathered the Iewes together in their cities within all ye londes of kynge Ahasuerus, to laye honde on soch as wolde do the euell, & no man coulde withstonde them: for ye feare of the was come ouer all people.
{9:3} And all the rulers in the londes, and prynces and Debities, and officers of the kinge promoted the Iewes: for the feare of Mardocheus came vpo the.
{9:4} For Mardocheus was greate in the kynges house, & the reporte of him was noised in all lodes, how he increased & grewe.
{9:5} Thus the Iewes smote all their enemies with a sore slaughter, and slewe and destroyed, & dyd after their wyll vnto soch as were their aduersaries.
{9:6} And at ye castell of Susan slewe the Iewes and destroied fyue hudreth men:
{9:7} & slewe Parsandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
{9:8} Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
{9:9} Parmastha Arissai, Aridai, Vaiesatha,
{9:10} the ten sonnes of Aman ye sonne of Amadathi ye enemie of the Iewes: but on his goodes they layed no handes.
{9:11} At the same tyme was the kynge certified of the nombre of those that were slaine at the castell of Susan.
{9:12} And the kynge sayde vnto quene Hester: The Iewes haue slayne and destroyed fyue hudreth men at ye castell of Susan, and the ten sonnes of Ama: What shal they do in the other londes of ye kynge? What is thy peticion, that it maye be geuen the? & what requirest thou more to be done?
{9:13} Hester sayde: Yf it please the kynge, let him suffre the Iewes tomorow also to do acordinge vnto this dayes commaundement, that they maye hange Amans ten sonnes vpo ye tre.
{9:14} And the kynge charged to do so, and the commaundement was deuysed at Susan, & Amans ten sonnes were hanged.
{9:15} And the Iewes gathered the selues together at Susan, vpon the fourtenth daye of the moneth Adar, and slewe thre hundreth men at Susan, but on their goodes they laied no hades.
{9:16} As for the other Iewes in the kyuges lodes, they came together, & stode for their lyues, & gatt rest fro their enemies: and slewe of their enemies fyue and seuentye thousande, howbeit they layed no hondes on their goodes.
{9:17} This was done on the thirteth daie of the moneth Adar, and on the fourtenth daye of the same moneth rested they, which (daye) they ordeyned to be a daye of feastinge and gladnesse.
{9:18} But the Iewes at Susan were come together both on the thyrtenth daye and on the fourtenth, and on the fyftenth daye they rested, and the same daye ordeyned they to be a daye of feastinge & gladnes.
{9:19} Therfore the Iewes that dwelt in the vyllages and vnwalled townes, ordeyned ye fourtenth daye of the moneth Adar, to be a daye of feastinge and gladnes, and one sent giftes vnto another.
{9:20} And Mardocheus wrote these actes, and sent the writinges vnto all the Iewes yt were in all ye londes of kynge Ahasuerus, both nye and farre,
{9:21} that they shulde yearly receaue and holde the fourtenth and fiftenth daie of the moneth Adar,
{9:22} as the daies wherin ye Iewes came to rest from their enemies, & as a moneth wherin their payne was turned to ioye, and their sorowe in to prosperite: that they shulde obserue the same as dayes of wealth and gladnes, and one to sende giftes vnto another, & to distribute vnto the poore.
{9:23} And the Iewes receaued it that they had begonne to do, and that Mardocheus wrote vnto them:
{9:24} how that Aman the sonne of Amadathai all ye Iewes enemye, had deuysed to destroye all the Iewes, and caused the lot to be cast for to put them in feare, and to brynge them to naughte:
{9:25} and how Hester wente and spake to the kynge, that thorow letters his wicked deuyce (which he ymagyned agaynst the Iewes) might be turned vpon his awne heade, and how he and his sonnes were hanged on the tre.
{9:26} For the which cause they called this daye Purim after the name of the lot, acordynge to all ye wordes of this wrytinge: and what they the selues had sene, and what had happened vnto them.
{9:27} And the Iewes set it vp, and toke it vpon them and their sede, and vpon all soch as ioyned themselues vnto them, that they wolde not mysse to obserue these two dayes yearly, acordynge as they were wrytte and appoynted,
{9:28} how yt these dayes are not to be forgotten, but to be kepte of childers children amoge all kynreds in all londes and cities. They are the dayes of Purim, which are not to be ouerslipte amonge the Iewes, and the memoriall of them oughte not to perishe from their sede.
{9:29} And quene Hester the daughter of Abihail and Mardocheus the Iewe, wrote with all auctorite, to confirme this seconde wrytinge of Purim,
{9:30} and sent the letters vnto all the Iewes in the hundreth and seuen and twentye londes of ye empyre of Ahasuerus, with frendly and faithfull wordes,
{9:31} to confirme these dayes of Purim, in their tyme appoynted, acordynges as Mardocheus the Iewe and Hester the quene had ordeined cocernynge them: lyke as they vpon their soule and vpon their sede had cofirmed the actes of the fastinges and of hir coplainte.
{9:32} And Hester comaunded to stablish these actes of this Purim, and to wryte them in a boke.
{10:1} And the kynge Ahasuerus layed tribute vpon the londe, and vpon the Iles of the See.
{10:2} As for all ye worke of his power and auctoryte, and ye greate worshippe of Mardocheus, which the kynge gaue him, beholde, it is wrytten in the Cronicles of the kynges of Media & Persia,
{10:3} For Mardocheus the Iewe was the seconde nexte vnto kynge Ahasuerus, and greate amonge ye Iewes, and accepted amonge the multitude of his brethren, as one yt seketh the welth of his people, and speaketh the best for all his sede.
